                The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state broadband policy explorer lets you learn
                how states are expanding access to broadband through laws. Categories in
                the tool include: <strong>broadband programs</strong>, <strong>competition and regulation</strong>, <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>funding
                and financing</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure access</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you choose categories, a 50-state map illustrates which states have
                adopted such laws.
              </p>
              <p>
                The state broadband policy explorer includes state statutes related to
                broadband <strong>as of Jan. 1, 2019</strong>.

                  <p>State policies create a framework for broadband deployment that lays out who can provide broadband, how they can provide it, and how expansion efforts are regulated and incentivized. The tool provides information on five categories that affect broadband deployment: state broadband programs, definitions, funding and financing, competition and regulation, and infrastructure access.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband programs:</strong> States structure their broadband programs in different ways. In some states, a centralized office coordinates these programs, while in others the responsibility is held by one or more departments or agencies, such as a department of economic development or department of commerce. States have also formed broadband commissions and task forces to address connectivity challenges.</p>
                  <p>State broadband offices, agency staff, commissions, and task forces have different scopes and responsibilities in different states. Their activities include establishing broadband goals, creating deployment plans, collecting and mapping broadband data, administering grant programs, and managing certification programs.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband office [Office]</strong> : Established by statute or through an executive order, a state broadband office is usually located in a department or agency.</p>
                  <p><strong>Agency with broadband authority [Agency]</strong> : States have designated one or more departments or agencies with responsibility for broadband.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband commission or task force [Task force]</strong> : Commissions and task forces generally include members representing multiple sectors, including state agencies, internet service providers (ISPs), local governments, and small businesses. Commissions often play a more formal role in administering broadband programs and funds, while task forces play an advisory or evaluative role.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband goal [Goal]</strong> : States generally identify targets for broadband coverage and speed, and include time frames for achieving these targets.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband plan [Plan]</strong> : States have plans with goals and strategies for increasing broadband access. Some states also have requirements for including broadband in local or regional plans.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband mapping [Mapping]</strong> : States have requirements for mapping where broadband service is available. They may also have public-facing broadband maps.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband Certification Programs [Promotional]</strong> : States have created certification programs to recognize local governments that have taken actions to improve broadband connectivity.</p>
                  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong> States define broadband by connection speed. These include speeds <strong>of [1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) download or less]</strong>, <strong>[download speeds of 10 megabits Mbps and upload speeds of 1 Mbps (10/1)]</strong> ; and <strong>[download speeds of 25 Mbps and upload speeds of 3 Mbps (25/3)]</strong> .</p>
                  <p>Other states define broadband by the technology <strong>[defined by technology, not speed]</strong> over which the service is delivered.</p>
                  <p>Some tie their definition of broadband to that of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <strong>[Defined by FCC or U.S. Code]</strong>. States may have multiple definitions of broadband that apply to different provisions in their statutes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, some states also define areas that are unserved <strong>[Unserved]</strong> and underserved <strong>[Underserved]</strong> by broadband. Most of these definitions define service by census block level. They consider speed, technology type, and the percentage of the area that does not have broadband service. State agencies use these definitions to determine which areas are eligible for state broadband grants and loans.</p>
                  <p><strong>Funding and financing:</strong> States use multiple mechanisms to support broadband expansion, including grants and loans, tax incentives, and bonds. They also use some funds designated for other purposes—such as spurring economic development—to support investment in broadband infrastructure.</p>
                  <p><strong>Broadband fund [Fund]</strong> : States have established funds dedicated to expanding broadband connectivity. Not all are regularly funded.</p>
                  <p><strong>Other funds that support broadband [Fund—other]</strong> : States have incorporated broadband into funds focused on broader purposes, such as economic development or opportunity in rural or economically distressed areas.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tax incentives [Tax incentives]</strong> : States have established tax incentives to promote broadband expansion. These include tax credits and exemptions for broadband equipment, and property tax exemptions for infrastructure.</p>
                  <p><strong>State universal service [State USF]</strong> : States have updated their state universal service funds—traditionally used to extend telephone service—to support broadband expansion.</p>
                  <p><strong>Other funding or financing mechanisms [Other]</strong> : States provide other mechanisms for funding and financing broadband. These include state and local bonding authorities, and authorizing local governments to provide grants or create financing districts.</p>
                  <p><strong>Competition and regulation:</strong> Some state statutes contain provisions defining which entities can provide broadband service, requirements for providing broadband service, and how broadband is regulated. Many of these laws focus on service provided by local governments or municipal utilities and electric and telephone cooperatives.</p>
                  <p><strong>Local government and municipal utilities [Municipal broadband]</strong> : States may allow or place limitations on the provision of wholesale or retail broadband service by local governments or municipal utilities.</p>
                  <p><strong>Electric and telephone cooperatives [Cooperatives]</strong> : Policies that expressly allow electric and telephone cooperatives to provide broadband service.</p>
                  <p><strong>Regulatory authority [Regulatory authority]</strong> : The authority of a public utilities commission, public service commission, or another state agency to regulate broadband.</p>
                  <p><strong>Other [Service provision—other]</strong> : Some states further address competition through provisions that restrict the use of state-owned networks for commercial broadband service and define local governments’ authority to regulate broadband infrastructure.</p>
                  <p><strong>Infrastructure access [Infrastructure access]:</strong> State policies address access to state-owned infrastructure to facilitate broadband expansion. These policies relate to a range of topics, including access to state-owned right of way, regulation of pole attachments, and the siting of wireless or small wireless facilities on state-owned land. States have also adopted policies that address access to locally owned infrastructure and assets to facilitate broadband expansion.</p>
                  <p><strong>Right of way [Dig once, railroad, ROW—other]</strong> : Policies address access to roads, railroads, tribal lands, and other public rights of way. “Dig once” statutes, which coordinate conduit installation with transportation projects with the goal of lowering costs for deployment and reducing construction in the right of way, fall under right of way policies.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pole attachments [Pole attachments]</strong> : Requirements regarding pole attachments (used to attach cables or fiber to telephone poles), including for municipalities, cooperatives, and publicly owned utilities. State statutes may direct the public utilities commission to adopt rules for pole attachments.</p>
                  <p><strong>Wireless [Wireless facilities] and small cell wireless facilities [Small cell facilities]</strong> : Policies define siting and permitting requirements for wireless and small wireless facilities to facilitate broadband connectivity.</p>
                  <p><strong>Other [Other infrastructure access]</strong> : States have additional policies governing providers’ access to infrastructure, including laws focused on access to multiunit dwellings and easements across private lands.</p>
                  <p><strong>Permitting [Permitting]</strong> : States have policies that address permits for broadband infrastructure, wireless facilities, or small cell facilities either by state agencies or localities.</p>
                  <p><strong>Open access [Open access]</strong> : Policies that define whether internet service providers can offer connectivity via a network they do not own or operate.</p>
                  <p><strong>Other:</strong> State policies that do not fit in the other categories. These policies include legislative intent <strong>[Legislative intent]</strong>, often a declaration of broadband’s importance to the state’s future. Other <strong>[Other]</strong> policies in this category address broadband-related wage requirements, advisory committee responsibilities, and agency directives, among others.</p>

Pursuant to the plan, the municipality may designate right-of-way adjacent to a municipal road or street or a county road to be developed, improved, and used for recreational or beautification purposes. Any portion of a road designated shall continue for at least three miles in length and may not at the time of designation have an average density of two or more commercial enterprises that have an entrance or exit on the road per mile. The path of the right-of-way along a street or road included in the plan may cross another street, road, or state highway. The establishment of a rural scenic right-of-way plan and the inclusion of any right-of-way of a county road shall be subject to approval of the county commission where any road included in the plan is located. In addition, any development and improvement within the rights-of-way along any county road shall be approved by the county commission. Any municipality establishing a rural scenic right-of-way plan shall be solely responsible for the development, maintenance, and use of the right-of-way included in the plan. The county shall not be responsible for the development, maintenance, access, or use of any right-of-way included in the plan, and shall not be liable for any damages to property or persons utilizing the right-of-way. A county may contribute financially to the implementation and development of the plan. No municipality or county shall be liable for any damages to any person using any right-of-way that is a part of the plan. (b) Nothing in this section shall in any way limit, restrict, or otherwise impact the ability of any electric supplier to maintain, repair, expand, construct, reconstruct, or relocate any facility or equipment used in the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric power or any communication service provider to maintain, repair, expand, construct, reconstruct, or relocate facilities or equipment for telecommunications, commercial mobile radio services, broadband services, or other wireless services within the public rights-of-way along, adjacent to, or surrounding any road, street, or highway included within this section; nor shall the placement of any such facilities or equipment be subject to approval by a county commission.

                      <p>(a)(1) Contingent on funding, during the 2016-2017 school year, local school systems may begin installing sufficient, high-quality standards-based broadband WiFi infrastructure and, where possible, mobile digital devices to enable access to digital instructional materials and, to the extent practicable, textbooks in electronic format. (2) In order to accomplish subdivision (1), the following priorities are established: a. Wireless infrastructure: The first priority for the expenditure of Alabama Ahead Act funds is the establishment of a high-quality, standards-based wireless local area network (WLAN) infrastructure capable of providing all teachers and students with sufficient WiFi broadband access in all classrooms and common areas of schools, where feasible as described in WIRED. b. Standards: Local school systems shall use applicable funds to install wireless networks or upgrade existing networks to satisfy Alabama Educational Technology Association (AET) standards that include high-quality, enterprise level networking equipment. Each regular classroom shall be equipped with high-quality wireless access for 30 to 40 devices simultaneously. Each specialty classroom, that routinely serves groups of less than 20 people, may satisfy a lesser standard. Each cafeteria shall have sufficient wireless access for one-third of the then current enrollment of the school. Each library media center shall be equipped with high quality wireless access for at minimum one-third of the capacity of the library media center. Each administrative and noninstructional area of a school shall have coverage, however, high density coverage is not required in these areas.</p>

                      <p>A. This section applies to the activities of a wireless provider within a right-of-way. B. An authority may not enter into an exclusive arrangement with a wireless provider for use of a right-of-way for any of the following: 1. The construction, installation, maintenance, modification, operation or replacement of utility poles or monopoles. 2. The collocation of small wireless facilities on utility poles or wireless support structures. 3. The collocation of wireless facilities on monopoles. C. An authority may charge a wireless provider a rate or fee for the use of a right-of-way for the construction, installation, maintenance, modification, operation or replacement of a utility pole in the right-of-way or the collocation of a small wireless facility in the right-of-way, only if the authority charges other communications service providers or publicly, cooperatively or municipally owned utilities for the use of the right-of-way and the authority has the legal authority to do so. If an authority charges a rate or fee pursuant to this section, the rate or fee for a wireless provider must be: 1. Limited to not more than the direct and actual cost of managing the right-of-way. 2. Competitively neutral in regard to other users of the right-of-way, including investor-owned, authority-owned or cooperatively owned entities, unless other users are exempt from such rates or fees under applicable law. D. A rate or fee charged pursuant to subsection C of this section may not do any of the following: 1. Result in a double recovery where existing rates, fees or taxes already recover the direct and actual costs of managing a right-of-way. 2. Be in the form of a franchise or other fee based on revenue or customer counts. 3. Be unreasonable or discriminatory. 4. Exceed an annual amount equal to fifty dollars multiplied by the number of small wireless facilities that are in the authority's geographic jurisdiction and that are placed by the wireless provider in the right-of-way. E. An authority shall establish and make available rates, fees and terms for all of the following, within six months after August 9, 2017 or three months after receiving the first request by a wireless provider, whichever is later: 1. The construction, installation, mounting, maintenance. F. The rates, fees and terms established pursuant to subsection E of this section must be made available for acceptance by a wireless provider. At the wireless provider's option, a wireless provider may request different or additional terms that the parties shall negotiate in good faith. Documents that reflect rates, fees and terms with each wireless provider are public records. Rates, fees and terms must comply with this article, and the terms: 1. May not be unreasonable or discriminatory. 2. May include requirements applicable to other users of the right-of-way. 3. May require that the wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities in the right-of-way does not interfere with the authority's public safety communications. 4. Subject to subsection K of this section and section 9-593, subsection F, may not require the placement of small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole or category of poles or require multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. 5. Subject to subsection K of this section and section 9-593, subsection F, may not limit the placement of small wireless facilities by minimum separation distances.</p>

                      <p>(a) (1) (A) An electric utility organized or domesticated under the laws of this state for the purpose of generating, transmitting, distributing, or supplying electricity to or for the public for compensation or for public use may construct, operate, and maintain such lines of wire, cables, poles, or other structures necessary for the transmission or distribution of electricity and broadband services: (i) Along and over the public highways and the streets of the cities and towns of the state; (ii) Across or under the waters of the state; (iii) Over any lands or public works belonging to the state; (iv) On and over the lands of private individuals or other persons; (v) Upon, along, and parallel to any railroad or turnpike of the state; and (vi) On and over the bridges, trestles, and structures of railroads. (B) In constructing such dams as the electric utility may be authorized to construct for the purpose of generating electricity by water power, the electric utility may flow the lands above the dams with backwater resulting from construction. (2) (A) However, the ordinary use of the public highways, streets, works, railroads, bridges, trestles, or structures and turnpikes shall not be obstructed, nor the navigation of the waters impeded, and just damages shall be paid to the owners of such lands, railroads, and turnpikes. (B) The permission of the proper municipal authorities shall be obtained for the use of the streets. (b) (1) In the event that an electric utility, upon application to the individual, railroad, turnpike company, or other persons, should fail to secure by consent, contract, or agreement, a right-of-way for the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) of this section, then the electric utility shall have the right to proceed to procure the condemnation of the property, lands, rights, privileges, and easements in the manner prescribed in this subchapter. (2) However, an electric utility shall not be required to secure by consent, contract, or agreement or to procure by condemnation the right to provide broadband services over its own lines of wire, cables, poles, or other structures that are in service at the time that the electric utility provides broadband services over the lines of wire, cables, poles, or other structures. (c) Whenever an electric utility desires to construct its line on or along the lands of individuals or other persons or on the right-of-way and the structures of any railroad or upon and along any turnpike, the electric utility, by its agent, shall have the right to enter peacefully upon the lands, structures, or right-of-way and survey, locate, and lay out its line thereon, being liable, however, for any damage that may result by reason of the acts.</p>

(2) (A) If an owner of property petitions a court under § 18-15-504(e), the amount of damages, if any, payable to the owner for the use of preexisting lines of wire, cables, poles, or other structures by an electric utility to provide broadband services shall be limited to an amount sufficient to compensate the property owner for the increased interference, if any, with the owner's use of the property caused by any new or additional physical attachments to the preexisting facility for the purpose of providing broadband services. (B) Evidence of revenues or profits derived by an electric utility from providing broadband services is not admissible for any purpose in a proceeding under § 18-15-504(e). (b) In all cases in which damages for the right-of-way for the use of the electric utility shall have been assessed in the manner provided, it shall be the duty of the electric utility to deposit with the court or pay to the owners the amount so assessed and pay such costs as may be in the discretion of the court be adjudged against it within thirty (30) days after the assessment. Whereupon, it shall and may be lawful for the electric utility to enter upon, use, and have the right-of-way over the lands forever. (c) In all cases in which the electric utility shall not pay or deposit the amount of damages assessed pursuant to this section, §§ 18-15-501 -- 18-15-506, § 18-15-508, and § 18-15-509 within thirty (30) days after the assessment, the electric utility shall forfeit all rights in the premises.</p>

                      <p>It is the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this subchapter to: (1) Provide for a system of regulation of telecommunications services, consistent with the federal act, that assists in implementing the national policy of opening the telecommunications market to competition on fair and equal terms, modifies outdated regulation, eliminates unnecessary regulation, and preserves and advances universal service; (2) Recognize that a telecommunications provider that serves high-cost rural areas or exchanges faces unique circumstances that require special consideration and funding to assist in preserving and promoting universal service; (3) Recognize that the: (A) Widespread and timely deployment of broadband infrastructure is vital to the economic, educational, health, and social interests of Arkansas and its citizens; and (B) Arkansas High Cost Fund has enabled eligible telecommunications carriers to accelerate and promote the incremental extension and expansion of broadband services and other advanced services in rural or high-cost areas of the state beyond what would normally occur, and broadband services are now available in dozens of new communities to thousands of Arkansans who otherwise would not have access to broadband services and its benefits; (4) (A) Recognize differences between the small and large incumbent local exchange carriers, that there are customer-owned telephone cooperatives and small locally owned investor companies, and that it is appropriate to provide incentives and regulatory flexibility to allow incumbent local exchange carriers that serve the rural areas to provide existing services and to introduce new technology and new services in a prompt, efficient, and economical manner. (B) The General Assembly finds that the Arkansas Public Service Commission, when promulgating rules and regulations, should take into consideration the differences in operating conditions in the large and small incumbent local exchange carriers and the burdens placed on small carriers because of regulation; and (5) (A) Recognize that in areas of the state served by electing companies, telecommunications connections utilizing unregulated technologies such as wireless and Voice over Internet Protocol greatly outnumber traditional wireline connections that remain regulated by the commission. (B) The General Assembly finds that the removal of quality-of-service regulation of wireline services provided in the competitive exchanges of electing companies will serve to encourage private-sector investment in the telecommunications marketplace.</p>

                      <p>(a) (1) The Arkansas High Cost Fund (AHCF) is established by this section in order to promote and assure the availability of universal service at rates that are reasonable and affordable and to provide for reasonably comparable services and rates between rural and urban areas. (2) The AHCF shall provide funding to an eligible telecommunications carrier that provides basic local exchange services and other supported services using its own facilities or a combination of its own facilities and another carrier's facilities by the eligible telecommunications carrier within its study area. (3) The AHCF shall be designed to provide predictable, sufficient, and sustainable funding to eligible telecommunications carriers serving rural or high-cost areas of the state. (4) The AHCF shall also be used to accelerate and promote the incremental extension and expansion of broadband services and other advanced services in rural or high-cost areas of the state beyond what would normally occur and support the Lifeline Assistance Program to eligible low-income customers. (b) (1) The AHCF is to provide a mechanism to restructure the present system of telecommunication service rates in the state as provided herein, and all telecommunications providers, except as prohibited by federal law, shall be charged for the direct and indirect value inherent in the obtaining and preserving of reasonable and comparable access to telecommunications services in the rural or high-cost areas. The value and utility of access to and interconnection with the public switched network will be lessened if the rural or high-cost areas do not have comparable access and subscribership. (2) (A) (i) This AHCF charge for all telecommunications providers shall be proportionate to each provider's Arkansas intrastate retail telecommunications service revenues. (ii) If the AHCF administrator determines or receives a petition from two-thirds (2/3) of the AHCF participants stating that the Arkansas intrastate retail telecommunications services revenues are inadequate to fully fund the AHCF requirements, the AHCF administrator shall notify the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the commission shall open a docket that will develop and implement a plan to fully fund the AHCF requirements.</p>

                      <p>(a) The commission shall exercise its regulatory authority to maintain the California High-Cost Fund-A Administrative Committee Fund program (CHCF-A program) to provide universal service rate support to small independent telephone corporations in amounts sufficient to meet the revenue requirements established by the commission through rate-of-return regulation in furtherance of the state’s universal service commitment to the continued affordability and widespread availability of safe, reliable, high-quality communications services in rural areas of the state. (b) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: (1) “Carrier of last resort” means a telephone corporation that is required to fulfill all reasonable requests for service within its service territory. (2) “Rate base” means the value of a telephone corporation’s plant and equipment that is reasonably necessary to provide regulated voice services and access to advanced services, and upon which the telephone corporation is entitled to a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return. (3) “Rate design” means the mix of end user rates, high-cost support, and other revenue sources that are targeted to provide a fair opportunity to meet the revenue requirement of the telephone corporation. (4) “Rate-of-return regulation” means a regulatory structure whereby the commission establishes a telephone corporation’s revenue requirements, and then fashions a rate design to provide the company a fair opportunity to meet the revenue requirement. (5) “Revenue requirement” means the amount that is necessary for a telephone corporation to recover its reasonable expenses and tax liabilities and earn a reasonable rate of return on its rate base. (6) “Small independent telephone corporations” are rural incumbent local exchange carriers subject to commission regulation. (c) In administering the CHCF-A program the commission shall do all of the following: (1) Continue to set rates to be charged by the small independent telephone corporations in accordance with Sections 451, 454, 455, and 728. (2) Employ rate-of-return regulation to determine a small independent telephone corporation’s revenue requirement in a manner that provides revenues and earnings sufficient to allow the telephone corporation to deliver safe, reliable, high-quality voice communication service and fulfill its obligations as a carrier of last resort in its service territory, and to afford the telephone corporation a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments, attract capital for investment on reasonable terms, and ensure the financial integrity of the telephone corporation. (3) Ensure that rates charged to customers of small independent telephone corporations are just and reasonable and are reasonably comparable to rates charged to customers of urban telephone corporations. (4) Provide universal service rate support from the California High-Cost Fund-A Administrative Committee Fund to small independent telephone corporations in an amount sufficient to supply the portion of the revenue requirement that cannot reasonably be provided by the customers of each small independent telephone corporation after receipt of federal universal service rate support. (5) Promote customer access to advanced services and deployment of broadband-capable facilities in rural areas that is reasonably comparable to that in urban areas, consistent with national communications policy. (6) Include all reasonable investments necessary to provide for the delivery of high-quality voice communication services and the deployment of broadband-capable facilities in the rate base of small independent telephone corporations. (7) Ensure that support is not excessive so that the burden on all contributors to the CHCF-A program is limited. (d) In order to participate in the CHCF-A program, a small independent telephone corporation shall meet all of the following requirements: (1) Be subject to rate-of-return regulation. (2) Be subject to the commission’s regulation of telephone corporations pursuant to this division. (3) Be a carrier of last resort in their service territory. (4) Qualify as a rural telephone company under federal law (47 U.S.C. Sec. 153(44)). (e) Upon request from the commission, a small independent telephone corporation that receives support from the CHCF-A program shall provide information regarding revenues derived from the provision of unregulated Internet access service by that corporation or its affiliate within that corporation’s telephone service territory. The commission shall treat as confidential any information provided pursuant to this subdivision. (f) The commission shall structure the CHCF-A program so that any charge imposed to promote the goals of universal service reasonably equals the value of the benefits of universal service to contributing entities and their subscribers. (g) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2023, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2023, deletes or extends that date.</p>

Directs the PUC to establish multiple accounts within the broadband fund and defines purposes and funding amounts for the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account ($300,000,000); the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account ($10,000,000); and the Broadband Adoption Account ($20,000,000). Projects funded through the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account must be made on a technology-neutral basis and provide Speed of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 1 Mbps upload to areas where offered speeds are not at least 6 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload and, before July 1, 2020, are not located in a census block where an existing facility-based provider has accepted Connect America Fund II monies. Up to $5 million in grants will be available to individual households or property owners toward extending a line to their property. Funds through the Broadband Adoption Account are to increase publicly available or after-school broadband access and digital inclusion in communities with limited broadband adoption, with preference given to communities with demonstrated low access, including communities with socioeconomic barriers to adoption and senior communities.</p>

                      <p>(a) The commission shall develop, implement, and administer the California Advanced Services Fund program to encourage deployment of high-quality advanced communications services to all Californians that will promote economic growth, job creation, and the substantial social benefits of advanced information and communications technologies, consistent with this section and with the statements of intent in Section 2 of the Internet For All Now Act (Assembly Bill 1665 of the 2017–18 Regular Session). (b) (1) (A) The goal of the program is, no later than December 31, 2022, to approve funding for infrastructure projects that will provide broadband access to no less than 98 percent of California households in each consortia region, as identified by the commission on or before January 1, 2017. The commission shall be responsible for achieving the goals of the program. (B) For purposes of this section, “unserved household” means a household for which no facility-based broadband provider offers broadband service at Speed of at least 6 megabits per second (mbps) downstream and one mbps upstream. (2) In approving infrastructure projects, the commission shall do both of the following: (A) Approve projects that provide last-mile broadband access to households that are unserved by an existing facility-based broadband provider, and, upon accomplishment of the goal of the program specified in paragraph (1), also approve projects pursuant to paragraph (15) of subdivision (f). (B) (i) Give preference to projects in areas where Internet connectivity is available only through dial-up service that are not served by any form of wireline or wireless facility-based broadband service or areas with no Internet connectivity. (ii) This subparagraph does not prohibit the commission from approving funding for projects outside of the areas specified in clause (i). (c) The commission shall establish the following accounts within the fund: (1) The Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account. (2) The Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account. (3) The Broadband Public Housing Account. (4) The Broadband Adoption Account. (d) (1) The commission shall transfer the moneys received by the commission from the surcharge imposed to fund the accounts to the Controller for deposit in the California Advanced Services Fund. Moneys collected shall be deposited in the following amounts in the following accounts:(A) Three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) into the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account. (B) Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) into the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account. (C) Twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) into the Broadband Adoption Account. (2) All interest earned on moneys in the fund shall be deposited in the fund. (3) The commission may collect a sum not to exceed three hundred thirty million dollars ($330,000,000) for a sum total of moneys collected by imposing the surcharge described in paragraph (1). The commission may collect the sum beginning with the calendar year starting on January 1, 2018, and continuing through the 2022 calendar year, in an amount not to exceed sixty-six million dollars ($66,000,000) per year, unless the commission determines that collecting a higher amount in any year will not result in an increase in the total amount of all surcharges collected from telephone customers that year. (e) All moneys in the California Advanced Services Fund shall be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the commission for the program administered by the commission pursuant to this section, including the costs incurred by the commission in developing, implementing, and administering the program and the fund. (f) (1) The commission shall award grants from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account on a technology-neutral basis, including both wireline and wireless technology. (2) The commission shall consult with regional consortia, stakeholders, local governments, existing facility-based broadband providers, and consumers regarding unserved areas and cost-effective strategies to achieve the broadband access goal through public workshops conducted at least annually no later than April 30 of each year through year 2022. (3) The commission shall identify unserved rural and urban areas and delineate the areas in the annual report prepared pursuant to Section 914.7. (4) (A) (i) The commission shall annually offer an existing facility-based broadband provider the opportunity to demonstrate that it will deploy broadband or upgrade existing facilities to a delineated unserved area within 180 days. (ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), the commission shall not approve funding for a project to deploy broadband to a delineated unserved area if the existing facility-based broadband provider demonstrates to the commission, in response to the commission’s annual offer, that it will deploy broadband or upgrade existing broadband service throughout the project area. (iii) If the existing facility-based broadband provider is unable to complete the deployment of broadband within the delineated unserved area within 180 days, the provider shall provide the commission with information to demonstrate what progress has been made or challenges faced in completing the deployment. If the commission finds that the provider is making progress towards the completion of the deployment, the commission shall extend the time to complete the project beyond the 180 days. If the commission finds that the provider is not making progress towards completing the deployment, the delineated unserved area shall be eligible for funding pursuant to this subdivision. (B) (i) Except for information specified in clause (ii), information submitted to the commission that includes the provider’s plans for future broadband deployment shall not be publicly disclosed. (ii) The commission may publicly disclose information regarding the area designated for a broadband deployment, the number of households or locations to be served, and the estimated date by which the deployment will be completed. (C) An existing facility-based broadband provider may, but is not required to, apply for funding from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account to make an upgrade pursuant to this subdivision. (5) Projects eligible for grant awards shall meet all of the following requirements: (A) The project deploys infrastructure capable of providing broadband access at Speed of a minimum of 10 megabits per second (mbps) downstream and one mbps upstream to unserved households in census blocks where no provider offers access at Speed of at least 6 mbps downstream and one mbps upstream. (B) All or a significant portion of the project deploys last-mile infrastructure to provide service to unserved households. Projects that only deploy middle-mile infrastructure are not eligible for grant funding. For a project that includes funding for middle-mile infrastructure, the commission shall verify that the proposed middle-mile infrastructure is indispensable for accessing the last-mile infrastructure. (C) (i) Except as provided in clause (ii), until July 1, 2020, the project is not located in a census block where an existing facility-based broadband provider has accepted federal funds for broadband deployment from Phase II of the Connect America Fund, unless the existing facility-based broadband provider has notified the commission before July 1, 2020, that it has completed its Connect America Fund deployment in the census block.(ii) An existing facility-based broadband provider is eligible for a grant pursuant to this subdivision to supplement a grant pursuant to Phase II of the Connect America Fund to expand broadband service within identified census blocks, as needed. (6) (A) An individual household or property owner shall be eligible to apply for a grant to offset the costs of connecting the household or property to an existing or proposed facility-based broadband provider. Any infrastructure built to connect a household or property with funds provided under this paragraph shall become the property of, and part of, the network of the facility-based broadband provider to which it is connected.(B) (i) In approving a project pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall consider limiting funding to households based on income so that funds are provided only to households that would not otherwise be able to afford a line extension to the property, limiting the amount of grants on a per-household basis, and requiring a percentage of the project to be paid by the household or the owner of the property. (ii) The aggregate amount of grants awarded pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000). (7) An entity that is not a telephone corporation shall be eligible to apply to participate in the program administered by the commission pursuant to this section to provide access to broadband to an unserved household, if the entity otherwise meets the eligibility requirements and complies with program requirements established by the commission.(8) The commission shall provide each applicant, and any party challenging an application, the opportunity to demonstrate actual levels of broadband service in the project area, which the commission shall consider in reviewing the application.(9) A local governmental agency may be eligible for an infrastructure grant only if the infrastructure project is for an unserved household or business, the commission has conducted an open application process, and no other eligible entity applied.(10) The commission shall establish a service list of interested parties to be notified of any California Advanced Services Fund applications. Any application and any amendment to an application for project funding shall be served to those on the service list and posted on the commission’s Internet Web site at least 30 days before publishing the corresponding draft resolution. (11) A grant awarded pursuant to this subdivision may include funding for the following costs consistent with paragraph (5) of subdivision (f): (A) Costs directly related to the deployment of infrastructure. (B) Costs to lease access to property or for Internet backhaul services for a period not to exceed five years. (C) Cost incurred by an existing facility-based broadband provider to upgrade its existing facilities to provide for interconnection. (12) A grant from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account shall not include funding for costs of broadband infrastructure already funded by the Connect America Fund program or other similar federal public program that funds that infrastructure. This paragraph does not apply to funding from the federal high-cost support programs that support operations, including High Cost Loop Support (HCLS), Connect America Fund-Broadband Loop Support (CAF-BLS), or the Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-CAM). (13) The commission may award grants to fund all or a portion of the project. The commission shall determine, on a case-by-case basis, the level of funding to be provided for a project and shall consider factors that include, but are not limited to, the location and accessibility of the area, the existence of communication facilities that may be upgraded to deploy broadband, and whether the project makes a significant contribution to achievement of the program goal. (14) The commission may require each infrastructure grant applicant to indicate steps taken to first obtain any available funding from the Connect America Fund program or similar federal public programs that fund broadband infrastructure. This paragraph does not authorize the commission to reject a grant application on the basis that an applicant failed to seek project funding from the Connect America Fund program or another similar federal public program. (15) Upon the accomplishment of the goal of the program specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), not more than thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) of the moneys remaining in the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account shall be available for infrastructure projects that provide last-mile broadband access to households to which no facility-based broadband provider offers broadband service at Speed of at least 10 mbps downstream and one mbps upstream.</p>

                      <p>(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (1) Increasing competition for video and broadband services is a matter of statewide concern for all of the following reasons: (A) Video and cable services provide numerous benefits to all Californians including access to a variety of news, public information, education, and entertainment programming. (B) Increased competition in the cable and video service sector provides consumers with more choice, lowers prices, speeds the deployment of new communication and broadband technologies, creates jobs, and benefits the California economy.(C) To promote competition, the state should establish a state-issued franchise authorization process that allows market participants to use their networks and systems to provide video, voice, and broadband services to all residents of the state. (D) Competition for video service should increase opportunities for programming that appeals to California’s diverse population and many cultural communities. (2) Legislation to develop this new process should adhere to the following principles:(A) Create a fair and level playing field for all market competitors that does not disadvantage or advantage one service provider or technology over another. (B) Promote the widespread access to the most technologically advanced cable and video services to all California communities in a nondiscriminatory manner regardless of socioeconomic status.(C) Protect local government revenues and control of public rights-of-way. (D) Require market participants to comply with all applicable consumer protection laws. (E) Complement efforts to increase investment in broadband infrastructure and close the digital divide. (F) Continue access to and maintenance of the public, education, and government (PEG) channels. (G) Maintain all existing authority of the California Public Utilities Commission as established in state and federal statutes. (3) The public interest is best served when sufficient funds are appropriated to the commission to provide adequate staff and resources to appropriately and timely process applications of video service providers and to ensure full compliance with the requirements of this division. It is the intent of the Legislature that, although video service providers are not public utilities or common carriers, the commission shall collect any fees authorized by this division in the same manner and under the same terms as it collects fees from common carriers, electrical corporations, gas corporations, telephone corporations, telegraph corporations, water corporations, and every other public utility providing service directly to customers or subscribers subject to its jurisdiction such that it does not discriminate against video service providers or their subscribers. (4) Providing an incumbent cable operator the option to secure a state-issued franchise through the preemption of an existing cable franchise between a cable operator and any political subdivision of the state, including, but not limited to, a charter city, county, or city and county, is an essential element of the new regulatory framework established by this act as a matter of statewide concern to best ensure equal protection and parity among providers and technologies, as well as to achieve the goals stated by the Legislature in enacting this act. (b) It is the intent of the Legislature that a video service provider shall pay as rent a franchise fee to the local entity in whose jurisdiction service is being provided for the continued use of streets, public facilities, and other rights-of-way of the local entity in order to provide service. The Legislature recognizes that local entities should be compensated for the use of the public rights-of-way and that the franchise fee is intended to compensate them in the form of rent or a toll, similar to that which the court found to be appropriate in Santa Barbara County Taxpayers Association v. Board of Supervisors for the County of Santa Barbara (1989) 209 Cal. App. 3d 940.(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that collective bargaining agreements be respected. (d) It is the intent of the Legislature that the definition of gross revenues in this division shall result in local entities maintaining their existing level of revenue from franchise fees.</p>

                      <p>(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free, open, and transparent competition. Only through free, open, and transparent competition can free markets, reasonable and just prices, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be ensured. The preservation and expansion of that competition are basic to the economic well-being of this state and that well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises is encouraged and developed. Therefore, it is the declared policy of the state to aid the interests of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises in order to preserve reasonable and just prices and a free competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for commodities, supplies, technology, property, and services for regulated public utilities, including, but not limited to, renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects, are awarded to women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the state. (b) (1) The Legislature finds all of the following: (A) The opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises is essential if this state is to attain social and economic equality for those businesses and improve the functioning of the state economy. (B) Public agencies and some regulated utilities that have established short- and long-range women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprise goals are awarding 30 percent or more of their contracts to these business enterprises. (C) Women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises have traditionally received less than a proportionate share of regulated public utility procurement contracts, especially in renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects. (D) It is in the state’s interest to expeditiously improve the economically disadvantaged position of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises. (E) The position of these businesses can be substantially improved by providing long-range substantial goals for procurement by regulated public utilities of technology, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work, especially in renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects, from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT businesses. (F) That procurement also benefits the regulated public utilities and consumers of the state by encouraging the expansion of the number of suppliers for procurements, thereby encouraging competition among the suppliers and promoting economic efficiency in the process. (G) That the long-term economic viability of this state depends substantially upon the ability of renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects to incorporate women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT businesses into those projects. (2) It is the purpose of this article to do all of the following: (A) Encourage greater economic opportunity for women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises. (B) Promote competition among regulated public utility suppliers in order to enhance economic efficiency in the procurement of electrical, gas, water, wireless telecommunications service provider, and telephone corporation contracts and contracts of their commission-regulated subsidiaries and affiliates. (C) Clarify and expand the program for the procurement by regulated public utilities of technology, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises.</p>

                      <p>The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) The Moore Universal Telephone Service Act, enacted in 1987, was intended to offer high quality basic telephone service at affordable rates to the greatest number of California residents, and has become an important means of achieving universal service by making residential service affordable to low-income citizens through the creation of a lifeline class of service. (b) Factors such as competition and technological innovation are resulting in the convergence of a variety of telecommunications technologies offering an expanded range of telecommunications services to users that incorporate voice, video, and data. These technologies have differing regulatory regimes and jurisdictions. (c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission initiate a proceeding investigating the feasibility of redefining universal telephone service by incorporating two-way voice, video, and data service as components of basic service. It is the Legislature’s further intent that, to the extent that the incorporation is feasible, that it promote equity of access to high-speed communications networks, the Internet, and other services to the extent that those services provide social benefits that include all of the following: (1) Improving the quality of life among the residents of California. (2) Expanding access to public and private resources for education, training, and commerce. (3) Increasing access to public resources enhancing public health and safety. (4) Assisting in bridging the “digital divide” through expanded access to new technologies by low-income, disabled, or otherwise disadvantaged Californians. (5) Shifting traffic patterns by enabling telecommuting, thereby helping to improve air quality in all areas of the state and mitigating the need for highway expansion. (d) For purposes of this section, the term “feasibility” means consistency with all of the following: (1) Technological and competitive neutrality. (2) Equitable distribution of the funding burden for redefined universal service as described in subdivision (c), among all affected consumers and industries, thereby ensuring that regulated utilities’ ratepayers do not bear a disproportionate share of funding responsibility. (3) Benefits that justify the costs.</p>

                      <p>(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that any program administered by the commission that addresses the inequality of access to high-speed broadband services by providing those services to schools and libraries at a discounted price, provide comparable discounts to a nonprofit community technology program. (b) Notwithstanding any other law or existing program of the commission, but consistent with the purposes for which those funds were appropriated from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund in Item 8660-001-0493 of Section 2.00 of the Budget Act of 2003 (Chapter 157 of the Statutes of 2003), and reappropriated in Item 8660-491 of Section 2.00 of the Budget Act of 2006 (Chapter 47 of the Statutes of 2006), the commission may expend up to two million dollars ($2,000,000) of the unencumbered amount of those funds for the nonrecurring installation costs for high-speed broadband services for community organizations that are eligible for discounted rates pursuant to Section 280. (c) For the purpose of this section: (1) “High-speed broadband services” means a system for the digital transmission of information over the Internet at a speed of at least 384 kilobits per second. (2) “Nonprofit community technology program” means a community-based nonprofit organization that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and engages in diffusing technology into local communities and training local communities that have no access to, or have limited access to, the Internet and advanced telecommunications technologies.</p>

                      <p>(1) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that: (a) The passage of House Bill 95-1335, enacted at the first regular session of the sixtieth general assembly, established a policy within the state to encourage competition among the various telecommunications providers, to reduce the barriers to entry for those providers, to authorize and encourage competition within the local exchange telecommunications market, and to ensure that all consumers benefit from such competition and expansion. (b) The stated goals of House Bill 95-1335 were that all citizens have access to a wider range of telecommunications services at rates that are reasonably comparable within the state, that basic service be available and affordable to all citizens, and that universal access to advanced telecommunications services would be available to all consumers. Such goals are essential to the economic and social well-being of the citizens of Colorado and can be accomplished only if telecommunications providers are allowed to develop ubiquitous, seamless, statewide telecommunications networks. To require telecommunications companies to seek authority from every political subdivision within the state to conduct business is unreasonable, impractical, and unduly burdensome. In addition, the general assembly further finds and declares that since the public rights-of-way are dedicated to and held on a nonproprietary basis in trust for the use of the public, their use by telecommunications companies is consistent with such policy and appropriate for the public good.</p>

(3) (a) There is hereby created, in the state treasury, the Colorado high cost administration fund, referred to in this section as the "fund", which shall be used to reimburse the commission and its contractors for reasonable expenses incurred in the administration of the high cost support mechanism, including administrative costs incurred in association with broadband service, as determined by rules of the commission. The general assembly shall appropriate annually the money in the fund that is to be used for the direct and indirect administrative costs incurred by the commission and its contractors. At the end of any fiscal year, all unexpended and unencumbered money in the fund remains in the fund and shall not be credited or transferred to the general fund or any other fund. </p>

                      <p>(2) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that to promote the state policy of providing universal access to broadband service, as set forth in section 40-15-502 (4), it may be necessary to provide financial assistance through additional support mechanisms if competition for local exchange services fails to deliver broadband service throughout the state. "Advanced service" includes "broadband service" for purposes of this section only.(3) The commission may allocate the Colorado high cost support mechanism, established under section 40-15-208 and referred to in this section as the "HCSM", for the deployment of broadband service in unserved areas of the state pursuant to this section and section 40-15-208 only. The commission may fund the deployment of broadband service in unserved areas of the state through use of the HCSM surcharge and surcharge rate in effect on January 1, 2018. Pursuant to subsection (4) of this section and consistent with sections 40-15-207 and 40-15-208, the commission shall determine funds available for broadband deployment and the administration of the board as prescribed in section 40-15-208 or from the HCSM money that it determines is no longer required by the HCSM to support universal basic service through an effective competition determination. The money available for broadband deployment shall be maintained by the HCSM third-party contractor and held in a separate account from money used for basic voice service. </p>

                      <p>The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) To foster economic development in this State, responsible and reasonable investment in and development of wireless communications systems employing advanced technology shall be encouraged as an integral part of the State's infrastructure. (2) The design, engineering, permitting, construction, modification, maintenance, and operation of wireless facilities are instrumental to the provision of emergency services, and to increasing access to advanced technology and information for the citizens of Delaware. (3) The Department of Transportation in accordance with § 131(a) of this title is responsible for the absolute care, management and control of the state rights-of-way. (4) Wireless services providers and wireless infrastructure providers are not public utilities under § 102(2) of Title 26, but need access to the state rights-of-way and the ability to attach to poles and structures in the state rights-of-way to densify their networks and provide next generation services subject to the same policies and procedures as public utilities for accommodation in the state rights-of-way. (5) Small wireless facilities, including facilities commonly referred to as small cells and distributed antenna systems, often may be deployed most effectively in the state rights-of-way. (6) Accordingly, expeditious processes and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates and terms related to such deployments are essential to the construction and maintenance of wireless facilities. (7) Wireless facilities help ensure the State remains competitive in the global economy. (8) The timely design, engineering, permitting, construction, modification, maintenance, and operation of wireless facilities are declared to be matters of statewide concern and interest.</p>

                      <p>(1)(a) The department and local governmental entities, referred to in this section and in ss. 337.402, 337.403, and 337.404 as the “authority,” that have jurisdiction and control of public roads or publicly owned rail corridors are authorized to prescribe and enforce reasonable rules or regulations with reference to the placing and maintaining across, on, or within the right-of-way limits of any road or publicly owned rail corridors under their respective jurisdictions any electric transmission, voice, telegraph, data, or other communications services lines or wireless facilities; pole lines; poles; railways; ditches; sewers; water, heat, or gas mains; pipelines; fences; gasoline tanks and pumps; or other structures referred to in this section and in ss. 337.402, 337.403, and 337.404 as the “utility.” The department may enter into a permit-delegation agreement with a governmental entity if issuance of a permit is based on requirements that the department finds will ensure the safety and integrity of facilities of the Department of Transportation; however, the permit-delegation agreement does not apply to facilities of electric utilities as defined in s. 366.02(2). (b) For aerial and underground electric utility transmission lines designed to operate at 69 or more kilovolts that are needed to accommodate the additional electrical transfer capacity on the transmission grid resulting from new base-load generating facilities, the department’s rules shall provide for placement of and access to such transmission lines adjacent to and within the right-of-way of any department-controlled public roads, including longitudinally within limited access facilities where there is no other practicable alternative available, to the greatest extent allowed by federal law, if compliance with the standards established by such rules is achieved. Without limiting or conditioning the department’s jurisdiction or authority described in paragraph (a), with respect to limited access right-of-way, such rules may include, but need not be limited to, that the use of the right-of-way for longitudinal placement of electric utility transmission lines is reasonable based upon a consideration of economic and environmental factors, including, without limitation, other practicable alternative alignments, utility corridors and easements, impacts on adjacent property owners, and minimum clear zones and other safety standards, and further provide that placement of the electric utility transmission lines within the department’s right-of-way does not interfere with operational requirements of the transportation facility or planned or potential future expansion of such transportation facility. If the department approves longitudinal placement of electric utility transmission lines in limited access facilities, compensation for the use of the right-of-way is required. Such consideration or compensation paid by the electric utility in connection with the department’s issuance of a permit does not create any property right in the department’s property regardless of the amount of consideration paid or the improvements constructed on the property by the utility. Upon notice by the department that the property is needed for expansion or improvement of the transportation facility, the electric utility transmission line will be removed or relocated at the electric utility’s sole expense. The electric utility shall pay to the department reasonable damages resulting from the utility’s failure or refusal to timely remove or relocate its transmission lines. The rules to be adopted by the department may also address the compensation methodology and removal or relocation. As used in this subsection, the term “base-load generating facilities” means electric power plants that are certified under part II of chapter 403. </p>

(b) At a public hearing required by this subsection, a governmental entity must, at a minimum, consider: 1. Whether the service that is proposed to be provided is currently being offered in the community and, if so, whether the service is generally available throughout the community. 2. Whether a similar service is currently being offered in the community and, if so, whether the service is generally available throughout the community. 3. If the same or similar service is not currently offered, whether any other service provider proposes to offer the same or a similar service and, if so, what assurances that service provider is willing or able to offer regarding the same or similar service. 4. The capital investment required by the government entity to provide the communications service, the estimated realistic cost of operation and maintenance and, using a full cost-accounting method, the estimated realistic revenues and expenses of providing the service and the proposed method of financing.5. The private and public costs and benefits of providing the service by a private entity or a governmental entity, including the affect on existing and future jobs, actual economic development prospects, tax-base growth, education, and public health. (c) At one or more of the public hearings under this subsection, the governmental entity must make available to the public a written business plan for the proposed communications service venture containing, at a minimum: 1. The projected number of subscribers to be served by the venture. 2. The geographic area to be served by the venture. 3. The types of communications services to be provided. 4. A plan to ensure that revenues exceed operating expenses and payment of principal and interest on debt within 4 years. 5. Estimated capital and operational costs and revenues for the first 4 years. 6. Projected network modernization and technological upgrade plans, including estimated costs. (d) After making specific findings regarding the factors in paragraphs (b) and (c), the governmental entity may authorize providing a communications service by a majority recorded vote and by resolution, ordinance, or other formal means of adoption. (e) The governing body of a governmental entity may issue one or more bonds to finance the capital costs for facilities to provide a communications service. However: 1. A governmental entity may only pledge revenues in support of the issuance of any bond to finance providing a communications service: a. Within the county in which the governmental entity is located; b. Within an area in which the governmental entity provides electric service outside its home county under an electric service territorial agreement approved by the Public Service Commission before the effective date of this act; or c. If the governmental entity is a municipality or special district, within its corporate limits or in an area in which the municipality or special district provides water, wastewater, electric, or natural gas service, or within an urban service area designated in a comprehensive plan, whichever is larger, unless the municipality or special district obtains the consent by formal action of the governmental entity within the boundaries of which the municipality or special district proposes to provide service. For consent to be effective, any governmental entity from which consent is sought shall be located within the county in which the governmental entity is located or that county. 2. Revenue bonds issued in order to finance providing a communications service are not subject to the approval of the electors if the revenue bonds mature within 15 years. Revenue bonds issued to finance providing a communications service that does not mature within 15 years must be approved by the electors. The election must be conducted as specified in chapter 100. (f) A governmental entity providing a communications service may not price any service below the cost of providing the service by subsidizing the communications service with moneys from rates paid by subscribers of a noncommunications services utility or from any other revenues. The cost standard for determining cross-subsidization is whether the total revenue from the service is less than the total long-run incremental cost of the service. Total long-run incremental cost means service-specific volume and nonvolume-sensitive costs. (g) A governmental entity providing a communications service must comply with the requirements of s. 218.32 and shall keep separate and accurate books and records, maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, of a governmental entity’s communication service, and they shall be made available for any audits of the books and records conducted under applicable law. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect costs, a local government shall develop and follow a cost-allocation plan, which is a procedure for allocating direct and indirect costs and which is generally developed in accordance with OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Government, published by the United States Office of Management and Budget. (h) The governmental entity shall establish an enterprise fund to account for its operation of communications services.</p>

(b) While recognizing and confirming the purview of local governments to exercise zoning, land use, and permitting authority within their territorial boundaries with regard to the location, construction, and modification of wireless communication facilities, it is the intent of this chapter to establish procedural standards for the exercise of such authority so as to streamline and facilitate the construction, collocation, or modification of such facilities, including the placement of new or additional wireless facilities on existing wireless support structures. It is not the intent of this chapter to limit or preempt the scope of a local government's review of zoning, land use, or permitting applications for the siting of wireless facilities or wireless support structures or to require a local government to exercise its zoning power.</p>

(b) The department, with input from broadband services providers and local governments, shall develop a model ordinance for the review of applications and the issuance of permits related to broadband network projects that complies with subsection (a) of this Code section that may be enacted by a political subdivision. (c) If a political subdivision enacts an ordinance that differs from the model ordinance developed by the department, the political subdivision shall, when applying for certification under Code Section 50-40-40, provide the department with a written statement that describes the ordinance enacted by such political subdivision and how such ordinance differs from the model ordinance. (d) After certification of a political subdivision as a broadband ready community, the department shall continue to monitor such political subdivision's compliance with the broadband ready community eligibility requirements provided in subsection (a) of this Code section to ensure that the ordinance is still in effect and that such political subdivision's actions are in conformance with such ordinance.</p>

                      <p>(a) On or before July 1, 2019, the Department of Community Affairs shall develop the "Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative" program to provide funding awards to expand broadband services to unserved areas of the state. The goal of such program shall be to provide broadband services coverage throughout the entire state. The funding awards of the program shall represent the state's investment in the deployment of broadband services to unserved areas and shall be used only for capital expenses and expenses directly related to the purchase or lease of property or communications services or facilities, including without limitation backhaul and transport, to facilitate the provision of broadband services. (b) (1) Funding awards, in the form of grants or loans, shall be competitively awarded to eligible applicants based on criteria consistent with this article and other factors established by the department; provided, however, that the department shall not discriminate between different types of broadband services technology as long as the technology is capable of transmitting data at the rates specified for each unserved area. (2) The department shall designate political subdivisions as eligible applicants that shall be qualified to apply for funding awards under this article. All such eligible applicants are hereby granted all powers necessary for any and all purposes of the program, and in the case of any development authority included as an eligible applicant, the exercise of such powers is hereby found and determined to promote the development of trade, commerce, industry, and employment opportunities. (c) Funding awards shall be based on appropriations of funds or receipt of other funds to support the program. (d) The department shall consider each of the following in the funding awards process: (1) The effectiveness of the partnership between an eligible applicant and a qualified broadband services provider; (2) The benefit to the unserved area in terms of the population served and the capacity and scalability of the technology to be deployed; and (3) The total project cost and the ability to leverage other available federal, local, and private funds. (e) In addition to the criteria provided in subsection (d) of this Code section, the department may establish any other criteria for determining any funding awards that are reasonable and necessary to ensure that the funds are utilized to provide broadband services to the unserved areas. Such criteria may include, but shall not be limited to: (1) Whether the qualified broadband services provider in the partnership is willing to agree to: (A) Not charge more for broadband services to customers in any unserved area for which a funding award is received than it does for the same or similar broadband services to customers in other areas of the state; (B) Serve 90 percent of any locations requesting broadband services in any unserved area for which a funding award is received; and (C) Meet or exceed in any unserved area for which it receives a grant a minimum level of dependable service as established by the department; (2) The benefit to businesses; industrial parks; education centers; hospitals and other health care facilities, such as telehealth facilities and emergency care facilities; government buildings; public safety departments; or other providers of public services located within the unserved area; (3) Data cap limits, signal latency, and reliability of the technology to be utilized; (4) Historic service issues in other areas served by the qualified broadband provider in the partnership; and (5) The length of time it will take to deploy the broadband services in the unserved area. (f) The department shall give competitive priority to any unserved area certified as a broadband ready community as provided in Article 3 of this chapter. Partnerships that include qualified broadband providers that cooperate in providing information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of Code Section 50-40-21, as applicable, shall also factor favorably into the competitive funding awards process. (g) The department shall ensure that the program complies with all applicable federal laws, rules, and regulations.</p>

                      <p>(a) The General Assembly recognizes that access to broadband services in today's society is essential to everyday life. Access to broadband services is a necessary service as fundamental as electricity, gas, or phone service. There is a growing need for the government of this state to provide the much needed infrastructure to the homes and businesses without access to broadband services due to their location in rural and other unserved areas. Furthermore, the General Assembly finds and declares that ensuring broadband services deployment will have a positive effect on education, health care, public safety, business and industry, government services, and leisure activities throughout the entire state. The General Assembly also finds and declares that guaranteeing an equitable deployment of broadband services throughout the state is a public necessity, one of the basic functions of government, and a benefit to the entire state. Moreover, the General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the best interest of the state and the persons who live and work in the state to spend state funds through the establishment of a grant program to ensure the creation of a state-wide foundation of broadband services infrastructure in unserved areas of the state. (b) The General Assembly hereby finds and determines that the economic benefits that will inure to the State of Georgia and designated political subdivisions from the Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative provided for in this article and from the performance by private sector persons and entities of the obligations that they will incur in connection with such Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative, will be equal to or greater than the benefits to be derived by such private sector persons and entities in connection therewith, and that, therefore, the Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative does not violate the prohibition in the Georgia Constitution on the payment by public bodies of gratuities to private sector persons or entities.</p>

(b) Each regional state infrastructure subaccount shall consist of the following sources of revenue: (1) Moneys received by the corporation from counties for the repayment of the loan principal and the payment of simple interest from various assessments or fees from special improvement districts, improvement districts, tax increment financing districts, community facilities districts, and other areas where property value increases are captured over periods of time for the purposes of infrastructure financing; (2) Appropriations from the legislature; (3) Federal grants and subsidies to the State or counties; (4) Private investments; and (5) Voluntary contributions. (c) The corporation shall expend revenues in the subaccounts to make grants and loans to state agencies, and loans to counties or private developers, for the costs, in whole or in part, of infrastructure improvements that would increase the capacity of the infrastructure facilities, including regional sewer systems, water systems, drainage systems, roads, and telecommunications and broadband. Grants and loans shall be made only for capital improvement projects approved by the respective county council and mayor, or state agency, as applicable, with a view towards planned growth rather than upkeep and maintenance. (d) Eligible costs shall include those for planning, design, feasibility studies, construction, and materials. No grant or loan shall be made: (1) For maintenance or repair costs unless the construction would simultaneously increase the carrying capacity of the infrastructure facility; or (2) Solely for mass transit or electrical utilities. The corporation may also expend revenues in the subaccounts to repay private investors for their investment plus any interest accrued on their investments made into the subaccounts to finance, in whole or in part, infrastructure improvements that would increase the capacity of the infrastructure facilities, including regional sewer systems, water systems, drainage systems, roads, and telecommunications and broadband. (e) The corporation may accept improved land from the counties or private developers in repayment of their loans. (f) The corporation shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 91 for the purposes of this section. </p>

At a minimum, the committee shall: (1) Make budget and policy recommendations to the state department of education regarding: (a) Broadband parameters; (b) Wireless LAN parameters; (c) Incentives for E-rate eligible entities to obtain the most appropriate service that best fits such entities’ broadband needs and that is fiscally responsible; (d) Incentives for districts to obtain the most appropriate service that best fits their wireless LAN needs and that is fiscally responsible; and (e) The minimum and maximum service levels, the quality of services and the minimum per student or person internet and wireless LAN levels that contracts must adhere to for E-rate eligible entities to be eligible for state reimbursement. (2) Establish reimbursement methodology that includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following components: (a) Distribution of appropriated moneys to E-rate eligible entities that have received E-rate funding. Distribution of such moneys must be in an amount equal to the non-E-rate reimbursed cost of internet services; (b) If E-rate funding is not available to an E-rate eligible entity for any reason, other than a failure of the entity to apply in good faith for available E-rate funding, reimburse the entity for its internet service costs; (c) Distribution of appropriated moneys remaining, after internet services are fully funded, for wide area networks (WANs). If necessary, the committee shall create an equalization formula for WAN distributions; and (d) Distribution of appropriated moneys for wireless LAN service to districts that either have received E-rate funding or have applied in good faith for E-rate funding. (3) Compile and analyze broadband utilization statistics from E-rate eligible entities to determine the levels of internet services necessary for such entities and report the statistics to the state department of education, and E-rate eligible entities shall cooperate with the committee in carrying out its duty to compile and analyze such information; (4) Advise and recommend resources to assist the state department of education in carrying out its responsibility to provide E-rate application assistance and support to E-rate eligible entities; (5) Not provide legal advice; (6) Collaborate with other relevant governmental and nongovernmental entities to ensure best practices in broadband and wireless LAN are used and to recommend the terms of contracts for broadband, wireless LAN and related services; and (7) Ensure compliance with appropriate purchasing laws.</p>

                      <p>(1) Subject to the limitations of this section, for taxable years beginning after January 1, 2001, there shall be allowed to a taxpayer a nonrefundable credit against taxes imposed by sections 63-3024, 63-3025 and 63-3025A, Idaho Code, for qualified expenditures in qualified broadband equipment in Idaho. (2) The credit permitted in subsection (1) of this section shall be three percent (3%) of the qualified investment in qualified broadband equipment in Idaho and shall be in addition to the credit for capital investment permitted by section 63-3029B, Idaho Code. (3) As used in this section the term: (a) "Qualified investment" shall be as defined in section 63-3029B, Idaho Code. (b) "Qualified broadband equipment" means equipment that qualifies for the credit for capital investment permitted by section 63-3029B, Idaho Code, and is capable of transmitting signals at a rate of at least two hundred thousand (200,000) bits per second to a subscriber and at least one hundred twenty-five thousand (125,000) bits per second from a subscriber, and (i) In the case of a telecommunications carrier, such qualifying equipment shall be necessary to the provision of broadband service and an integral part of a broadband network. "Telecommunications carrier" has the meaning given such term by section 47 U.S.C. 153 of the communications act of 1934, as amended, but does not include a commercial mobile service provider. (ii) In the case of a commercial mobile service carrier, such qualifying equipment shall extend from the subscriber side of the mobile telecommunications switching office to a transmitting/receiving antenna, including such antenna, on the outside of the structure in which the subscriber is located. "Commercial mobile service carrier" means any person authorized to provide commercial mobile radio service to subscribers as defined in section 20.3 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (10-1-99 ed.), as amended. (iii) In the case of a cable or open video system operator, such qualifying equipment shall extend from the subscriber’s side of the headend to the outside of the structure in which the subscriber is located. The terms "cable operator" and "open video system operator" have the meanings given such terms by sections 602(5) and 653, respectively, of the communications act of 1934, as amended. (iv) In the case of a satellite carrier or a wireless carrier other than listed above, such qualifying equipment is only that equipment that extends from a transmitting/receiving antenna, including such antenna, which transmits and receives signals to or from multiple subscribers to a transmitting/receiving antenna on the outside of the structure in which the subscriber is located. "Satellite carrier" means any person using the facilities of a satellite or satellite services licensed by the federal communications commission and operating a fixed-satellite service or direct broadcast satellite services to provide point-to-multipoint distribution of signals. "Other wireless carrier" means any person, other than a telecommunications carrier, commercial mobile service carrier, cable operator, open video operator, or satellite carrier, providing broadband services to subscribers through the radio transmission of energy. (v) In the case of packet switching equipment, such packet equipment installed in connection with other qualifying equipment listed in subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iv) of this section, provided it is the last in a series of equipment that transmits signals to a subscriber or the first in a series of equipment that transmits signals from a subscriber. "Packet switching" means controlling or routing the path of a digital transmission signal which is assembled into packets or cells. (vi) In the case of multiplexing and demultiplexing equipment, such equipment only to the extent that it is deployed in connection with providing broadband services in locations between packet switching equipment and the structure in which the subscriber is located. "Multiplexing" means the transmission of two (2) or more signals over a communications circuit without regard to the communications technology. (vii) Any property not primarily used to provide services in Idaho to public subscribers is not qualified broadband equipment. (4) No equipment described in subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(vi) of this section shall qualify for the credit provided in subsection (1) of this section until the taxpayer applies to and obtains from the Idaho public utilities commission an order confirming that the installed equipment is qualified broadband equipment. Applications submitted to the commission shall be governed by the commission’s rules of procedure. The commission may issue procedural orders necessary to implement this section. (5) The credit allowed by subsection (1) of this section together with any credits carried forward under subsection (7) of this section shall not, in any one (1) taxable year, exceed the lesser of: (a) The amount of tax due under sections 63-3024, 63-3025 and 63-3025A, Idaho Code, after allowance for all other credits permitted by this chapter; or (b) Seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000). When credits earned in more than one (1) taxable year are available, the oldest credits shall be applied first. (6) In the case of a group of corporations filing a combined report under subsection (t) of section 63-3027, Idaho Code, credit earned by one (1) member of the group but not used by that member may be used by another member of the group, subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, instead of carried over. For a combined group of corporations, credit carried forward may be claimed by any member of the group unless the member who earned the credit is no longer included in the combined group. (7) If the credit allowed by subsection (1) of this section exceeds the limitation under subsection (5) of this section, the excess amount may be carried forward for a period that does not exceed the next fourteen (14) taxable years. (8) In the event that qualified broadband equipment upon which the credit allowed by this section has been used ceases to qualify for the credit allowed by section 63-3029B, Idaho Code, or is subject to recapture of that credit, the recapture of credit under this section shall be in the same proportion and subject to the same provisions as the amount of credit required to be recaptured under section 63-3029B, Idaho Code. (9) (a) Subject to the requirements of this subsection, a taxpayer who earns and is entitled to the credit or to an unused portion of the credit allowed by this section may transfer all or a portion of the unused credit to: (i) Another taxpayer required to file a return under this chapter; or (ii) To an intermediary for its use or for resale to a taxpayer required to file a return under this chapter. In the event of either such a transfer, the transferee may claim the credit on the transferee’s income tax return originally filed during the calendar year in which the transfer takes place and, in the case of carryover of the credit, on the transferee’s returns for the number of years of carryover available to the transferor at the time of the transfer unless earlier exhausted. (b) Before completing a transfer under this subsection, the transferor shall notify the state tax commission of its intention to transfer the credit and the identity of the transferee. The state tax commission shall provide the transferor with a written statement of the amount of credit available under this section as then appearing in the commission’s records and the number of years the credit may be carried over. The transferee shall attach a copy of the statement to any return in regard to which the transferred credit is claimed. (c) In the event that after the transfer the state tax commission determines that the amount of credit properly available under this section is less than the amount claimed by the transferor of the credit or that the credit is subject to recapture, the commission shall assess the amount of overstated or recaptured credit as taxes due from the transferor and not the transferee. The assessment shall be made in the manner provided for a deficiency in taxes under this chapter. (10) In addition to other needed rules, the state tax commission may promulgate rules prescribing, in the case of S corporations, partnerships, trusts or estates, a method of attributing the credit under this section to the shareholders, partners or beneficiaries in proportion to their share of the income from the S corporation, partnership, trust or estate.</p>

                      <p>(a) The holder of a State-issued authorization shall not deny access to cable service or video service to any potential residential subscribers because of the race or income of the residents in the local area in which the potential subscribers reside. (b) (Blank).(c)(1) If the holder of a State-issued authorization is using telecommunications facilities to provide cable or video service and has more than 1,000,000 telecommunications access lines in this State, the holder shall provide access to its cable or video service to a number of households equal to at least 35% of the households in the holder's telecommunications service area in the State within 3 years after the date a holder receives a State-issued authorization from the Commission and to a number not less than 50% of these households within 5 years after the date a holder receives a State-issued authorization from the Commission; provided that the holder of a State-issued authorization is not required to meet the 50% requirement in this paragraph (1) until 2 years after at least 15% of the households with access to the holder's video service subscribe to the service for 6 consecutive months. The holder's obligation to provide such access in the State shall be distributed, as the holder determines, within 3 designated market areas, one in each of the northeastern, central, and southwestern portions of the holder's telecommunications service area in the State. The designated market area for the northeastern portion shall consist of 2 separate and distinct reporting areas: (i) a city with more than 1,000,000 inhabitants, and (ii) all other local units of government on a combined basis within such designated market area in which it offers video service. If any state, in which a holder subject to this subsection (c) or one of its affiliates provides or seeks to provide cable or video service, adopts a law permitting state-issued authorization or statewide franchises to provide cable or video service that requires a cable or video provider to offer service to more than 35% of the households in the cable or video provider's service area in that state within 3 years, holders subject to this subsection (c) shall provide service in this State to the same percentage of households within 3 years of adoption of such law in that state. Furthermore, if any state, in which a holder subject to this subsection (c) or one of its affiliates provides or seeks to provide cable or video service, adopts a law requiring a holder of a state-issued authorization or statewide franchises to offer cable or video service to more than 35% of its households if less than 15% of the households with access to the holder's video service subscribe to the service for 6 consecutive months, then as a precondition to further build-out, holders subject to this subsection (c) shall be subject to the same percentage of service subscription in meeting its obligation to provide service to 50% of the households in this State. (2) Within 3 years after the date a holder receives a State-issued authorization from the Commission, at least 30% of the total households with access to the holder's cable or video service shall be low-income. Within each designated market area listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), the holder's obligation to offer service to low-income households shall be measured by each exchange, as that term is defined in Section 13-206 of this Act in which the holder chooses to provide cable or video service. The holder is under no obligation to serve or provide access to an entire exchange; however, in addition to the statewide obligation to provide low-income access provided by this Section, in each exchange in which the holder chooses to provide cable or video service, the holder shall provide access to a percentage of low-income households that is at least equal to the percentage of the total low-income households within that exchange. </p>

                      <p> (a) The Digital Divide Elimination Infrastructure Fund is created as a special fund in the State treasury. All moneys in the Fund shall be used, subject to appropriation, by the Commission to fund (i) the construction of facilities specified in Commission rules adopted under this Section and (ii) the accessible electronic information program, as provided in Section 20 of the Accessible Electronic Information Act. The Commission may accept private and public funds, including federal funds, for deposit into the Fund. Earnings attributable to moneys in the Fund shall be deposited into the Fund. (b) The Commission shall adopt rules under which it will make grants out of funds appropriated from the Digital Divide Elimination Infrastructure Fund to eligible entities as specified in the rules for the construction of high-speed data transmission facilities in eligible areas of the State. For purposes of determining whether an area is an eligible area, the Commission shall consider, among other things, whether (i) in such area, advanced telecommunications services, as defined in subsection (c) of Section 13-517 of this Act, are under-provided to residential or small business end users, either directly or indirectly through an Internet Service Provider, (ii) such area has a low population density, and (iii) such area has not yet developed a competitive market for advanced services. In addition, if an entity seeking a grant of funds from the Digital Divide Elimination Infrastructure Fund is an incumbent local exchange carrier having the duty to serve such area, and the obligation to provide advanced services to such area pursuant to Section 13-517 of this Act, the entity shall demonstrate that it has sought and obtained an exemption from such obligation pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 13-517. Any entity seeking a grant of funds from the Digital Divide Elimination Infrastructure Fund shall demonstrate to the Commission that the grant shall be used for the construction of high-speed data transmission facilities in an eligible area and demonstrate that it satisfies all other requirements of the Commission's rules. The Commission shall determine the information that it deems necessary to award grants pursuant to this Section. (c) The rules of the Commission shall provide for the competitive selection of recipients of grant funds available from the Digital Divide Elimination Infrastructure Fund pursuant to the Illinois Procurement Code. Grants shall be awarded to bidders chosen on the basis of the criteria established in such rules. (d) All entities awarded grant moneys under this Section shall maintain all records required by Commission rule for the period of time specified in the rules. Such records shall be subject to audit by the Commission, by any auditor appointed by the State, or by any State officer authorized to conduct audits.</p>

                      <p> (a) Any action or proceeding pending before the Commission upon the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General Assembly in which it is alleged that a telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive, other than a case pertaining to Section 13-506.1, shall be abated and shall not be maintained or continued. (b) All retail telecommunications services provided to business end users by any telecommunications carrier subject, as of May 1, 2001, to alternative regulation under an alternative regulation plan pursuant to Section 13-506.1 of this Act shall be classified as competitive as of the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General Assembly without further Commission review. Rates for retail telecommunications services provided to business end users with 4 or fewer access lines shall not exceed the rates the carrier charged for those services on May 1, 2001. This restriction upon the rates of retail telecommunications services provided to business end users shall remain in force and effect through July 1, 2005; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit reduction of those rates. Rates for retail telecommunications services provided to business end users with 5 or more access lines shall not be subject to the restrictions set forth in this subsection. (c) All retail vertical services, as defined herein, that are provided by a telecommunications carrier subject, as of May 1, 2001, to alternative regulation under an alternative regulation plan pursuant to Section 13-506.1 of this Act shall be classified as competitive as of June 1, 2003 without further Commission review. Retail vertical services shall include, for purposes of this Section, services available on a subscriber's telephone line that the subscriber pays for on a periodic or per use basis, but shall not include caller identification and call waiting. (d) Any action or proceeding before the Commission upon the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General Assembly, in which it is alleged that a telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive, other than a case pertaining to Section 13-506.1, shall be abated and the services the classification of which is at issue shall be deemed either competitive or noncompetitive as set forth in this Section. Any telecommunications carrier subject to an action or proceeding in which it is alleged that the telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive shall be deemed liable to refund, and shall refund, the sum of $90,000,000 to that class or those classes of its customers that were alleged to have paid rates in excess of noncompetitive rates as the result of the alleged improper classification. The telecommunications carrier shall make the refund no later than 120 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General Assembly. (e) Any telecommunications carrier subject to an action or proceeding in which it is alleged that the telecommunications carrier has improperly classified services as competitive shall also pay the sum of $15,000,000 to the Digital Divide Elimination Fund established pursuant to Section 5-20 of the Eliminate the Digital Divide Law, and shall further pay the sum of $15,000,000 to the Digital Divide Elimination Infrastructure Fund established pursuant to Section 13-301.3 of this Act. The telecommunications carrier shall make each of these payments in 3 installments of $5,000,000, payable on July 1 of 2002, 2003, and 2004.

                      <p>With respect to cable and video competition, the General Assembly finds that: (a) The economy in the State of Illinois will be enhanced by investment in new communications, cable services, and video services infrastructure, including broadband facilities, fiber optic, and Internet protocol technologies. (b) Cable services and video services bring important daily benefits to Illinois consumers by providing news, education, and entertainment. (c) Competitive cable service and video service providers are capable of providing new video programming services and competition to Illinois consumers and of decreasing the prices for video programming services paid by Illinois consumers. (d) Although there has been some competitive entry into the facilities-based video programming market since current franchising requirements in this State were enacted, further entry by facilities-based providers could benefit consumers, provided cable and video services are equitably available to all Illinois consumers at reasonable prices. (e) The provision of competitive cable services and video services is a matter of statewide concern that extends beyond the boundaries of individual local units of government. Notwithstanding the foregoing, public rights-of-way are limited resources over which the municipality has a custodial duty to ensure that they are used, repaired, and maintained in a manner that best serves the public interest. (f) The State authorization process and uniform standards and procedures in this Article are intended to enable rapid and widespread entry by competitive providers, which will bring to Illinois consumers the benefits of video competition, including providing consumers with more choice, lower prices, higher speed and more advanced Internet access, more diverse and varied news, public information, education, and entertainment programming, and will bring to this State and its local units of government the benefits of new infrastructure investment, job growth, and innovation in broadband and Internet protocol technologies and deployment. (g) Providing an incumbent cable or video service provider with the option to secure a State-issued authorization through the termination of existing cable franchises between incumbent cable and video service providers and any local franchising authority is part of the new regulatory framework established by this Article. This Article is intended to best ensure equal treatment and parity among providers and technologies.</p>

(d) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the owner of any multiple-unit residential dwelling nor an agent or representative from requiring that a holder's facilities conform to reasonable conditions necessary to protect safety, functioning, appearance, and value of premises or the convenience and safety of persons or property. (e) The owner of any multiple-unit residential dwelling or an agent or representative may require a holder to agree to indemnify the owner, or his agents or representatives, for damages or from liability for damages caused by the installation, operation, maintenance, or removal of cable service or video service facilities.

Exempts a municipality with a population of 1 million or more from the provisions of this act. Prohibits local governments from prohibiting, regulating, or charging for the co-location of small cell facilities. Requires that small cell facilities be classified as permitted uses and subject only to administrative review if they are in the right of way in any zone or outside the right of way in property zoned for commercial or industrial use. Prohibits the local government from requiring unrelated services from the application, including in-kind contributions. Allows the local government to request site-specific structural integrity and a make-ready analysis for a utility pole, the location of each proposed facility and photographs of the utility pole and its immediate surroundings, specification types and drawings, and the make and model of equipment to be installed, as well as the proposed schedule for installation. However, the local government cannot require placement on any specific utility pole or category of poles. Requires providers to comply with reasonable, technically feasible design measures in a historic district or on a historic landmark, but these requirements cannot have the effect of prohibiting the provider’s technology. Sets timelines for reviewing applications and allows up to 25 facilities to be submitted on a single application. Addresses maximum application fees for co-location and facilities that require new utilities.</p>

Because of the integral role that the delivery of wireless technology plays in the economic vitality of the State of Illinois and in the lives of its citizens, the General Assembly has determined that a law addressing the deployment of wireless technology is of vital interest to the State. To ensure that public and private Illinois consumers continue to benefit from these services as soon as possible and to ensure that providers of wireless access have a fair and predictable process for the deployment of small wireless facilities in a manner consistent with the character of the area in which the small wireless facilities are deployed, the General Assembly is enacting this Act, which specifies how local authorities may regulate the collocation of small wireless facilities. </p>

                      <p>(a) This section applies to an electricity supplier that: (1) installs new communications infrastructure; or (2) makes capacity available for communications service through existing communications infrastructure; within an electric easement under this chapter. (b) As used in this section, "notice" means a written letter: (1) that is sent by first class mail by the electricity supplier to the property owner; and (2) that includes the following information: (A) The name, address, and telephone number of the electricity supplier, along with a named point of contact for the electricity supplier.(B) Either: (i) the address and name associated with the impacted property; or (ii) if the name of the property owner is not known by the electricity supplier, the address associated with the affected property, with the letter addressed to "The property owner of (street address, city, state, and ZIP code of the affected property)". (C) A citation to this chapter. (D) A statement indicating the electricity supplier's intent to: (i) install new communications infrastructure; or (ii) make capacity available for communications service through existing communications infrastructure; as applicable, within the electric easement. (E) An estimate of when: (i) installation of new communications infrastructure will occur; or (ii) communications service will be made available through existing communications infrastructure; as applicable, within the electric easement. (F) A statement explaining the electricity supplier's right to record a new easement under section 14 of this chapter. (G) A summary of the property owner's right to obtain an appraisal under section 11 of this chapter and to bring an action under section 12 of this chapter, including: (i) a statement of the time limit for bringing an action, as set forth in section 10 of this chapter; and (ii) a statement explaining that the property owner is precluded from exercising the rights that are otherwise available to the property owner under sections 11 and 12 of this chapter if the property owner signs an agreement, a master agreement, or an affidavit described in section 9 of this chapter. (H) Subject to subsections (f) and (g), a written plan for making broadband Internet service available within the electricity supplier's electric service territory, including the following information, to the extent the information is available to and known by the electricity supplier: (i) A description of the proposed area or areas in which the broadband Internet service is to be made available. (ii) A map of the proposed area or areas identified under item (i). (iii) A proposed timetable for making broadband Internet service available in the area or areas identified under item (i). (iv) A statement as to whether the electricity supplier, an affiliated entity, or a third party would provide the broadband Internet service to be made available.

(c) An electricity supplier shall provide notice to a property owner upon whose property the electricity supplier will: (1) install new communications infrastructure; or (2) make capacity available for communications service through existing communications infrastructure; within an electric easement under this chapter. An electricity supplier's provision of a notice that substantially conforms to the requirements set forth in subsection (b) constitutes the provision of notice for purposes of this section. (d) Delivery of notice under this section occurs on the date upon which the notice is mailed by an electricity supplier to a property owner. An electricity supplier may prove delivery of notice under this section by any official or generally accepted time stamped document, whether maintained in physical form or electronically by the electricity supplier.

(e) If: (1) installation of new communications infrastructure does not occur; or (2) communications service is not made available through existing communications infrastructure; within the electric easement within one hundred eighty (180) days after notice under this section is delivered, as determined under subsection (d), the electricity supplier shall resend notice under this section to the property owner, and the time period set forth in section 10 of this chapter restarts based on the date the subsequent notice is delivered, as determined under subsection (d). A property owner's exclusive remedy for an electricity supplier's failure to provide notice as required under this section is the resetting of the time period set forth in section 10 of this chapter. (f) This section does not require an electricity supplier, an affiliated entity of an electricity supplier, or a communications service provider to disclose confidential and proprietary business plans and other confidential information. (g) The failure of an electricity supplier to: (1) make broadband Internet service available in any area identified in the plan required by subsection (b)(2)(H); (2) meet the proposed timetable for making broadband Internet service available in any area identified in the plan required by subsection (b)(2)(H); (3) accurately estimate the costs to the electricity supplier's members of any infrastructure necessitated by the plan required by subsection (b)(2)(H); or (4) otherwise take any actions described in, or related to, the plan required by subsection (b)(2)(H); does not create any liability with respect to the electricity supplier beyond that which would otherwise apply under applicable law and, except as provided in section 1(c) of this chapter, does not preclude the electricity supplier from using the procedures set forth in this chapter.</p>

                      <p> (a) In determining whether to award a grant under this chapter in connection with a proposed qualified broadband project, the office shall consider the following: (1) Awarding grants under this chapter with a preference for funding proposed qualified broadband projects that will provide Internet connections to the most unserved areas at the highest speeds for the lowest grant amount per area. (2) The community's need for, and the likely economic impact of, the proposed qualified broadband project in the unserved area. (3) Demonstrated community support for the proposed qualified broadband project, including the certification of one (1) or more communities to be served by the project as broadband ready communities under IC 5-28-28.5. (4) The likelihood that the unserved area will not be served with qualified broadband service without state grant funding. (5) Whether funding has been allocated for the unserved area from the federal Connect America Fund or from any other similar federal funding program. (6) Whether the broadband infrastructure proposed in connection with the qualified broadband project is scalable to higher download and upload speeds. (7) Awarding grants for qualified broadband projects that will serve a larger unserved area or a greater number of locations within an unserved area. (8) The useful life of the broadband network proposed to be deployed. (9) The technical, managerial, and financial capabilities of the applicant. (10) The ability of the applicant to commit to providing at least twenty percent (20%) of the cost to deploy the proposed broadband infrastructure. When multiple applicants apply for a grant to provide broadband service to the same census block within an unserved area, the office may establish a preference for approving applications with a greater capital contribution by the applicant. (11) Any proposed plans to encourage the adoption and use of broadband services within the unserved area. (12) Any other factors the office considers appropriate to enable the deployment of broadband infrastructure to provide qualified broadband service in unserved areas in Indiana. (b) The following conditions apply to the awarding of grants under this chapter: (1) The office shall not award a grant with respect to any geographic area if information made available to the office, through comments or objections received under section 7(c) of this chapter or otherwise, indicates any of the following: (A) The area is already being served by at least one (1) provider offering qualified broadband service in the area. However, any person may, in a petition filed with the office, provide evidence that one (1) or more locations within one (1) or more census blocks in the area are unserved areas. Upon receiving a petition described in this clause, the office shall notify all broadband providers operating in all census blocks included in the petition. Those broadband providers may in turn demonstrate to the office that the locations included in the petition: (i) are already served with qualified broadband service; or (ii) will be served with qualified broadband service not later than eighteen (18) months after the date of the application for a grant under this chapter. </p>

                      <p>(a) In imposing a civil penalty under section 6(b)(4) of this chapter, the commission may consider the following factors: (1) The duration and gravity of the offense, including the number of customers affected. (2) Economic benefits accrued by the provider or certificate holder as a result of the offense. (3) The amount of a civil penalty that will deter future offenses by the provider or certificate holder. (4) The market share of the provider or certificate holder in the affected service areas. (5) Good faith of the provider or certificate holder in attempting to remedy the offense after receiving notification of the offense. (b) If the commission waives a civil penalty for any offense described in section 6(b)(4) of this chapter, the commission must make a written finding as to why it is waiving the civil penalty. The commission may waive a civil penalty under section 6(b)(4) of this chapter if the commission finds that the offense is the result of any of the following: (1) Technological infeasibility. (2) An act of God. (3) A defect in, or prohibited use of, customer provided equipment. (4) A negligent act of a customer. (5) An emergency situation. (6) Unavoidable casualty. (c) The secretary of the commission shall direct a civil penalty imposed and collected under section 6(b)(4) of this chapter as follows: (1) A civil penalty imposed for an offense that directly affects retail customers must be refunded directly to the customers of the provider or certificate holder in the form of credits on customer bills. (2) A civil penalty imposed for an offense not described in subdivision (1) must be deposited into an account designated by the Indiana economic development corporation for use by the corporation in making loans or grants to broadband developers and operators.</p>

Prohibits a local authority from requiring a permit or charging fees for routine maintenance, replacing facilities with substantially similar facilities, or for the location of small wireless facilities. Allows the local authority to prohibit placement of new support structures in the right of way of underground districts zoned for residential land use before May 1, 2017. Prohibits the authority from charging application fees for a permit unless fees are charged for similar development and the fee is based on actual, direct, and reasonable costs incurred through the review process. Prohibits the permit authority from discriminating against communications service providers. Land use laws and zoning ordinances still apply, and this section does not exempt providers from complying with those ordinances. However, small cell facilities are exempt from local zoning requirements if the facility meets the provisions outlined in this chapter. Addresses what applications must include and reviews timelines. Sets the fee for a small cell installation at $100 per facility. Does not authorize the co-location on privately owned poles or wireless support structures, or private property without the consent of the owner. For poles and support structures owned by a public utility, requires the entity seeking to place small cell equipment to gain the necessary permission.

(2) A permit authority shall allow an applicant to submit a single consolidated application for multiple small cell facilities that are located within the permit authority's jurisdiction and constitute a single small cell network. The permit authority shall issue a single permit for the small cell network rather than multiple permits for each small cell facility. (3) The total of any application fees allowed under this section may not exceed the lesser of: (A) the amount charged by the permit authority for an application for a building permit for any similar type of commercial: (i) construction; (ii) activity; or (iii) land use development; within the jurisdiction of the permit authority; or (B) one hundred dollars ($100) per small cell facility included in the application. (4) With respect to an application for the construction, placement, or use of a small cell facility and the associated supporting structure at a location where a supporting structure does not exist, a permit authority may propose, as an alternative location for the proposed small cell facility, that the small cell facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or on an existing wireless support structure, if the existing utility pole or the existing wireless support structure is located within fifty (50) feet of the location proposed in the application. </p>

(2) Offers or grants incentives or rewards to an owner of real property if the incentives or rewards are contingent upon the property owner's agreement to restrict or limit: (A) the ability of another communications service provider to obtain easements or rights-of-way for the installation of facilities or equipment used to provide communications service on the property; or (B) access to the owner's real property by another communications service provider. A contract, an agreement, or any other arrangement that violates this section is void if the contract, agreement, or arrangement is entered into after March 27, 2006. However, a contract, an agreement, or any other arrangement that otherwise violates this section remains in effect until such time as it would normally terminate or expire if the contract, agreement, or arrangement is entered into before March 28, 2006. (b) This section does not prohibit a communications service provider and a subscriber from entering into any lawful contract, agreement, or other arrangement concerning the communications service offered by the communications service provider to the subscriber. (c) Upon: (1) a complaint filed by: (A) another communications service provider; (B) a subscriber or potential subscriber of communications service; (C) the utility consumer counselor; or (D) any class satisfying the standing requirements of IC 8-1-2-54; or (2) the commission's own motion; the commission may investigate whether a communications service provider has violated this section. If, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, the commission determines that the communications service provider has violated this section, the commission may issue an order imposing a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500) for each violation. For purposes of this subsection, each day that a contract, an agreement, or an arrangement prohibited by this section remains in effect constitutes a separate violation. (d) The attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state to enforce an order of the commission under subsection (c), including the collection of an unpaid civil penalty imposed by the commission. (e) Civil penalties collected under this section shall be deposited in the state general fund. (f) A determination by the commission under this section is subject to appeal under IC 8-1-3.</p>

The department or the board of supervisors may consult with the office of the chief information officer to access additional information needed to review an application. (3) The department or the board of supervisors, as applicable, shall, by March 1, notify an applicant of approval or denial of an application for an exemption under this subsection and shall also notify the applicant of the applicant’s right to an appeal. (4) The board of supervisors shall forward all approved applications and any necessary information regarding the applications to the appropriate local assessor by March 1 annually.

                      <p>1.a. Except as provided in this section, an authority shall not prohibit or restrict the siting of a small wireless facility. b. For purposes of this section, “siting” means the mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation, or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to any of the following: (1) An existing tower, utility pole, wireless support structure, or other existing structure. (2) A new utility pole of a similar height and appearance as an existing utility pole and which is located within a five-hundred-foot radius of the existing utility pole. (3) A replacement utility pole of a similar height and appearance as an existing utility pole and which is located within a five-hundred-foot radius of the existing utility pole. 2.a. An authority that has adopted planning and zoning regulations shall authorize the siting of a small wireless facility within its jurisdiction and shall not require a person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit for any of the following: (1) For siting the small wireless facility in a public right-of-way or on an authority structure located outside of a public right-of-way to the extent that such structure is already in use as a wireless support structure by supporting non-authority communications equipment that involve external attachments, provided that such structure is not listed on the national register of historic places. (2) For siting the small wireless facility on an existing tower, utility pole, or wireless support structure, regardless of the location, except for on property zoned and used exclusively for single-family residential use or within a previously designated area of historical significance pursuant to section 303.34. b. A small wireless facility may be classified as a special or conditional land use where such small wireless facility is not sited in a manner as provided in paragraph “a”. c. A person may install a new utility pole or wireless support structure in a public right-of-way subject to the provisions of this section. An authority may reasonably limit the number of new utility poles or wireless support structures, consistent with the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, and provided that such limitation does not have the effect of prohibiting or significantly impairing a wireless service provider’s ability to provide wireless service within the area of a proposed new structure. However, an authority may require a person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to install a new utility pole or wireless support structure for the siting of a small wireless facility on property zoned and used exclusively for single-family residential use or within a previously designated area of historical significance pursuant to section 303.34. 3.a.(</p>

                      <p>(c) (1) An authority shall not charge an application fee, consulting fee or other fee associated with the submission, review, processing and approval of an application that is not required for other wireless infrastructure providers or wireline telecommunications or broadband providers within the authority's jurisdiction. (2) An authority shall only assess fees or charges for the actual costs relating to the granting or processing of an application that are directly incurred by the authority and the authority shall not charge any market-based or value-based fees for the processing of an application. Such fees and charges shall be reasonably related in time to the occurrence of such costs. (3) An authority or any third-party entity shall not include any travel expenses incurred in the review of an application for more than one trip per application to the authority's jurisdiction and an applicant shall not be required to pay or reimburse an authority for a consultant or other third-party fees based on a contingency-based or results-based arrangement. Any travel expenses included must be reasonable and directly related to the application. (4) The total charges and fees assessed by the authority shall not exceed: (A) $500 for a collocation application, that is not a substantial modification, small cell facility application or distributed antenna system application; or (B) $2,000 for an application for a new wireless support structure or for a collocation application that is a substantial modification of a wireless support structure. (d) (1) An authority may not charge a wireless services provider or wireless infrastructure provider any rental, license or other fee to locate a wireless facility or wireless support structure on any public right-of-way controlled by the authority, if the authority does not charge other telecommunications or video service providers, alternative infrastructure or wireless services providers or any investor-owned utilities or municipally-owned commercial broadband providers for the use of public right-of-way. If an authority does assess a charge, including a charge or rental fee for attachment to the facilities owned by the authority in the right-of-way, any such charge must be competitively neutral, with regard to other users of the public right-of-way, including investor-owned utilities or municipally-owned commercial broadband providers, and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory or violate any applicable state or federal law, rule or regulation. (2) (A) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, a wireless services provider or wireless infrastructure provider, subject to an application, shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate wireless support structures, utility poles, small cell wireless facilities or distributed antenna systems along, across, upon, under or above the public right-of-way. The authority must be competitively neutral with regard to other users of the public right-of-way, may not be unreasonable or discriminatory and may not violate any applicable state or federal law, rule or regulation. (B) Nothing in this subsection (d) shall be interpreted as granting a wireless services provider or wireless infrastructure provider the right to construct, maintain or operate any facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the authority outside of the public right-of-way. (C) The right of a wireless services provider or wireless infrastructure provider to use and occupy the public right-of-way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the authority. An authority may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the public right-of-way provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory.</p>

                      <p>A. The legislature hereby finds that in northeast Louisiana, which has a poverty rate that is nearly double the national average and whose economy is severely and chronically depressed, there is an urgent need to address issues related to poverty, education, health care, economic development and jobs, housing, and culture. Approximately one in four individuals in northeast Louisiana lives in poverty. Seven out of the state's ten parishes with the highest child poverty rates are in northeast Louisiana. Infant mortality rates in this region are among the highest in the state. The region has among the lowest per capita incomes in the state and among the highest rates of uninsured and unemployed adults. A large percentage of the region's public schools are considered academically below average. Immediate steps must be taken to form a multifaceted initiative to identify and implement ways to solve the region's problems, to assist the region's individuals, families, and businesses as they strive for success and economic survival, and to improve the quality of life and standards of living for the region's citizens. An opportunity must be facilitated to engage citizens of different backgrounds and areas of expertise in order to achieve long-term growth and development in the region, and a framework must be designed for such an initiative that provides for an exchange of ideas in a comprehensive and coordinated effort and for the widespread implementation of solutions in the region. B.(1) The center shall plan, develop, and implement a Delta Development Initiative, referred to in this Section as the "Delta initiative", as provided in this Section. (2) The Delta initiative shall be implemented in the parishes of Caldwell, Catahoula, Concordia, East Carroll, Franklin, Madison, Morehouse, Ouachita, Pointe Coupee, Richland, Tensas, and West Carroll. Such parishes shall be referred to in this Section as the "Delta" or the "Delta region". C. The purpose of the Delta initiative shall be to provide for a dynamic and comprehensive approach to planning, developing, and implementing solutions to problems of the Delta region in Louisiana by utilizing all possible available resources, and specifically to address problems related to poverty, education, health care, economic development and jobs, housing, and culture. D. To carry out the purpose of the Delta initiative and to plan, develop, and implement solutions to problems in the Delta region as provided in Subsection C of this Section, the center shall collaborate, consult, and coordinate with entities in the public and private sector with particular expertise and resources to provide effective solutions, including but not limited to the following: (1) The governor's Office on Rural Development. (2) Louisiana Department of Economic Development. (3) The Board of Regents. (4) Each public postsecondary education management board. (5) The University of Louisiana at Monroe and its Small Business Development Center. (6) The Southern Regional Education Board. (7) Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at Shreveport. (8) The Delta Regional Authority. (9) The Louisiana State University AgCenter. (10) The Southern University AgCenter. (11) Delta Community College. (12) Louisiana Tech University. (13) Grambling State University. (14) Louisiana Center Against Poverty. (15) Northeast Economic Development District. (16) All other appropriate technical and community colleges located in the Delta region. E. The center shall plan, develop, and implement components of the Delta initiative to accomplish the purpose of the Delta initiative as provided in Subsection C of this Section. Such components shall include the following at a minimum and such other components as the center may identify or the legislature may suggest: (1) A government leadership academy. The center shall establish an academy to train elected local government officials to carry out their responsibilities. The academy also may provide training on management and operations issues, including legal aspects thereof, such as public records, ethics, purchasing and procurement, personnel management, financial management, conflict resolution, conduct of board meetings and board business, and leadership educational programs. (2) A rural entrepreneurship program, including a business incubator. The center shall spur the creation and sustainability of new rural businesses and shall implement a business incubator program that provides high-speed Internet access to give Delta business owners the necessary technological infrastructure to create new companies and expand into global markets. The center also shall teach adult entrepreneurs how to start and manage e-businesses, including how to establish storefront businesses on the Internet, how to develop web sites, and how to utilize an array of educational programs that can be accessed using distance education technology and regional partnerships with economic development institutions and organizations. The center also shall teach young people in the Delta region business management skills, such as marketing, finance, and economics, necessary to start and develop businesses, including how to buy and sell items on the Internet and provide opportunities for Delta young people to work with local retailers to expand their businesses into global markets. </p>

Except as provided in Section II.D.2 and Section IV, the authority, powers, duties, functions, responsibilities, records, personnel, property, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds, including, but not limited to, the functions of budgeting and procurement, of the Michigan Broadband Development Authority and the Board of Directors of the Michigan Broadband Development Authority under the Michigan Broadband Development Authority Act, 2002 PA 49, MCL 484.3201 to 484.3225, are transferred to the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. 2. The authority, powers, duties, functions, responsibilities, records, personnel, property, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds, including, but not limited to, the functions of budgeting and procurement, of the Michigan Broadband Development Authority under Section 7(1)(d) of the Michigan Broadband Development Authority Act, 2002 PA 49, MCL 484.3207(1)(d), are transferred to the Michigan Public Service Commission.

A municipality may issue bonds for the purpose of financing the development, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of broadband infrastructure in any locations within a municipality unserved by broadband as defined in RSA 38:38, I(c). Without limiting the foregoing, broadband infrastructure may be the subject of public-private partnerships established in accordance with the provisions of RSA 33:3.
                        II. Bonds issued under this section shall be payable in annual payments so that the amount of annual payment of principal and interest in any year on account of any bond shall be not less than the amount of principal and interest payable in any subsequent year by more than 5 percent of the principal of the entire bond. The total amount of payments shall be sufficient to extinguish the entire bond at such bond's maturity. The first payment of principal on any bond shall be made no later than 5 years and the last payment not later than 30 years after the date issued. Each authorized issue of bonds shall be a separate and distinct loan.
                        III. A municipality shall not issue bonds for the purpose of financing the development, construction, reconstruction, renovation, improvement, and acquisition of broadband infrastructure in any location within a municipality unserved by broadband as defined in RSA 38:38, I(c) unless a request for information has been issued, at a minimum, to all providers serving the issuing community and such providers have been given 2 months to respond to the request. The request for information may include, but is not limited to, information identifying locations within a municipality unserved by broadband as defined in RSA 38:38, I(c). After completing, issuing, and receiving responses to such request for information, a municipality may issue a request for proposals for the purpose of engaging in a public-private partnership pursuant to RSA 33:3 or RSA 33-B for the deployment of broadband infrastructure, as defined in RSA 38:38, I(e), and the provision of broadband service as defined in RSA 38:38, I(f). A municipality may select a proposal based on criteria including, but not limited to, provider ability to deploy, manage, and maintain a broadband network which meets or exceeds the anticipated needs of the community. A municipality may determine that no provider has met the criteria included in the request for proposals and may issue bonds for purposes pursuant to RSA 33:3 and RSA 33-B, including but not limited to, open networks.</p>

A city may petition the Commission to serve multiple contiguous unserved areas in the same proceeding.</p>

Establishes the terms for use of public right of way to encourage the deployment of small cell and advanced wireless facilities. Recognizes the authority of municipal corporations to manage right of way and the need to promote coordination and standardization of municipal management of right of way, as well as timely review processes. Addresses protection of aesthetics in residential and historic districts. Deems applications of co-location of small cell facilities or construction and operation of wireless support structures in the public right of way to be a permitted use not subject to zoning review. Further requires the municipality to respond to applications within 90 days to co-locate, modify, or replace a small cell facility on a wireless facility or 120 days to construct, modify, or replace wireless structures. If the municipality does not meet this review timeline, the application is deemed granted. Allows consolidated applications for small cell facilities and wireless support structures (up to 30 of each) if the consolidated application includes facilities of substantially the same type. Enumerates things that municipalities cannot do in relation to provision of small cell facilities and wireless support structures, including requiring justification for the need for the facility or removal of existing facilities, or imposing any regulations that are beyond those imposed for other facilities or are stricter than federal requirements. Enumerates things that municipalities can do in relation to provision of small cell facilities and wireless support structures, including adopting reasonable design guidelines, proposing alternative locations for wireless support structures, and setting height restrictions for wireless support structures within defined parameters. Processing or application fees charged by municipalities cannot exceed a one-time fee of $250 per small cell facility. This fee can be adjusted by 10 percent every five years. Defines the period of approval attaching small cell facilities to wireless support structures as 10 years, with a presumption of renewal for five-year terms thereafter. Requires municipalities to permit co-location of small cell facilities in the public right of way. Allows municipalities to condition approval of co-location on replacement or modification of a wireless support structure at the operator’s cost if necessary for compliance with the municipality’s written construction and safety standards. Sets a cap on the annual charge for co-location on a wireless support structure owned by a municipal corporation to $200 per small cell facility, to be adjusted by 10 percent every five years. Prohibits municipalities from taxing small cell facilities. Prohibits municipalities from entering into exclusive agreements for access to wireless support structures. Allows them to delay processing applications for small cell facilities by mutual agreement of the municipality and the applicant, if the application is incomplete, or if the volume of applications is too high to reasonably review. Defines the conditions and time periods for delays. Indemnifies municipalities and local officials in case damages are sought by operators of small cell facilities or public services for injury and property damage resulting from installing, repairing, or maintaining facilities in the public right of way. Requires municipalities to provide competitively neutral access to right of way.</p>

                      <p>The Rhode Island general assembly finds that growth and enhancement of services using Internet protocol technology provide Rhode Island consumers more choice in voice, data and video services than at any other time. The proliferation of new technologies and applications and the growing number of providers developing and offering innovative services using Internet protocol are due in large part to little barrier to investment, including freedom from state laws and regulations governing traditional telephone service, that these technologies have enjoyed in Rhode Island, as well as recognition that federal law is more uniform in its oversight of Internet protocol-enabled services. The economic benefits, including consumer choice, new jobs and significant capital investment, will be jeopardized and competition minimized by the imposition of traditional state entry, rate and service term regulation on voice-over-Internet protocol service and Internet protocol-enabled service. </p>

                      <p> (a) The legislature finds that broadband over power lines, also known as BPL, is an emerging technology platform that offers a means of providing broadband services to reach homes and businesses. BPL services can also be used to enhance existing electric delivery systems, which can result in improved service and reliability for electric customers.(b) The legislature finds that access to quality, high speed broadband services is important to this state. BPL deployment in Texas has the potential to extend broadband service to customers where broadband access is currently not available and may provide an additional option for existing broadband consumers in Texas, resulting in a more competitive market for broadband services. The legislature further finds that BPL development in Texas is fully dependent upon the participation of electric utilities in this state that own and operate power lines and related facilities that are necessary for the construction of BPL systems and the provision of BPL services. (c) Consistent with the goal of increasing options for telecommunications in this state, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the deployment of BPL by permitting affiliates of the electric utility, or permitting unaffiliated entities, to own or operate all or a portion of such BPL systems. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the appropriate framework to support the deployment of BPL. (d) The legislature finds that an electric utility may choose to implement BPL under the procedures set forth in this chapter, but is not required to do so. The electric utility shall have the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether to implement BPL and may not be penalized for deciding to implement or not to implement BPL.</p>

The ubiquitous nature of these connections must allow individual networks of these entities to interconnect and interoperate across the broadband digital service infrastructure. The delivery of these advanced telecommunications services requires collaborations and partnerships of public, private, and commercial telecommunications service network providers. (b) The goal of this subchapter is to interconnect and aggregate the connections to every entity described in this subchapter, in the local serving area. It is further intended that the infrastructure implemented under this subchapter connect each entity that requests a service offered under this subchapter.</p>

                      <p>(1) The legislature finds and declares the following: (a) The deployment and adoption of high-speed internet services and information technology has resulted in enhanced economic development and public safety for the state's communities, improved health care and educational opportunities, and a better quality of life for the state's residents; (b) Continued progress in the deployment and adoption of high-speed internet services and other advanced telecommunications services, both land-based and wireless, is vital to ensuring Washington remains competitive and continues to create business and job growth; and (c) That the state must encourage and support strategic partnerships of public, private, nonprofit, and community-based sectors in the continued growth and development of high-speed internet services and information technology for state residents and businesses. (2) Therefore, in order to begin advancing the state towards further growth and development of high-speed internet in the state, and to ensure a better quality of life for all state residents, it is the legislature's intent to conduct a statewide needs assessment of broadband internet resources through an open dialogue with all interested parties, including providers, unions, businesses, community organizations, local governments, and state agencies. The legislature intends to use this needs assessment in guiding future plans on how to ensure that every resident in Washington state may gain access to high-speed internet services and, as part of this effort, to address digital literacy and technology training needs of low-income and technology underserved residents of the state through state support of community technology programs.
