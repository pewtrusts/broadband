### Glossary

State policies create a framework for broadband deployment that lays out who can provide broadband, how they can provide it, and how expansion efforts are regulated and incentivized. The tool provides information on five categories that affect broadband deployment: state broadband programs, definitions, funding and financing, competition and regulation, and infrastructure access. Each law in the tool is labeled with one of these categories, as well as a topic that describes the law in more detail. In cases where one law belongs to multiple topics, the topic is also listed in parentheses after the name in order to differentiate between the two entries.

**Broadband programs:** States structure their broadband programs in different ways. In some states, a centralized office coordinates these programs, while in others the responsibility is held by one or more departments or agencies, such as a department of economic development or department of commerce. States have also formed broadband commissions and task forces to address connectivity challenges.

State broadband offices, agency staff, commissions, and task forces have different scopes and responsibilities in different states. Their activities include establishing broadband goals, creating deployment plans, collecting and mapping broadband data, administering grant programs, and managing certification programs.

**Broadband office [Office]** : Established by statute or through an executive order, a state broadband office is usually located in a department or agency.

**Agency with broadband authority [Agency]** : States have designated one or more departments or agencies with responsibility for broadband.

**Broadband commission or task force [Task force]** : Commissions and task forces generally include members representing multiple sectors, including state agencies, internet service providers (ISPs), local governments, and small businesses. Commissions often play a more formal role in administering broadband programs and funds, while task forces play an advisory or evaluative role.

**Broadband goal [Goal]** : States generally identify targets for broadband coverage and speed, and include time frames for achieving these targets.

**Broadband plan [Plan]** : States have plans with goals and strategies for increasing broadband access. Some states also have requirements for including broadband in local or regional plans.

**Broadband mapping [Mapping]** : States have requirements for mapping where broadband service is available. They may also have public-facing broadband maps.

**Broadband Certification Programs [Promotional]** : States have created certification programs to recognize local governments that have taken actions to improve broadband connectivity.

**Definitions:** States define broadband by connection speed. These include speeds **of [1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) download or less]**, **[download speeds of 10 megabits Mbps and upload speeds of 1 Mbps (10/1)]** ; and **[download speeds of 25 Mbps and upload speeds of 3 Mbps (25/3)]** .

Other states define broadband by the technology **[defined by technology, not speed]** over which the service is delivered.

Some tie their definition of broadband to that of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) **[Defined by FCC or U.S. Code]**. States may have multiple definitions of broadband that apply to different provisions in their statutes.

Finally, some states also define areas that are unserved **[Unserved]** and underserved **[Underserved]** by broadband. Most of these definitions define service by census block level. They consider speed, technology type, and the percentage of the area that does not have broadband service. State agencies use these definitions to determine which areas are eligible for state broadband grants and loans.

**Funding and financing:** States use multiple mechanisms to support broadband expansion, including grants and loans, tax incentives, and bonds. They also use some funds designated for other purposes—such as spurring economic development—to support investment in broadband infrastructure.

**Broadband fund [Fund]** : States have established funds dedicated to expanding broadband connectivity. Not all are regularly funded.

**Other funds that support broadband [Fund—other]** : States have incorporated broadband into funds focused on broader purposes, such as economic development or opportunity in rural or economically distressed areas.

**Tax incentives [Tax incentives]** : States have established tax incentives to promote broadband expansion. These include tax credits and exemptions for broadband equipment, and property tax exemptions for infrastructure.

**State universal service [State USF]** : States have updated their state universal service funds—traditionally used to extend telephone service—to support broadband expansion.

**Other funding or financing mechanisms [Other]** : States provide other mechanisms for funding and financing broadband. These include state and local bonding authorities, and authorizing local governments to provide grants or create financing districts.

**Competition and regulation:** Some state statutes contain provisions defining which entities can provide broadband service, requirements for providing broadband service, and how broadband is regulated. Many of these laws focus on service provided by local governments or municipal utilities and electric and telephone cooperatives.

**Local government and municipal utilities [Municipal broadband]** : States may allow or place limitations on the provision of wholesale or retail broadband service by local governments or municipal utilities.

**Electric and telephone cooperatives [Cooperatives]** : Policies that expressly allow electric and telephone cooperatives to provide broadband service.

**Regulatory authority [Regulatory authority]** : The authority of a public utilities commission, public service commission, or another state agency to regulate broadband.

**Other [Service provision—other]** : Some states further address competition through provisions that restrict the use of state-owned networks for commercial broadband service and define local governments’ authority to regulate broadband infrastructure.

**Infrastructure access [Infrastructure access]:** State policies address access to state-owned infrastructure to facilitate broadband expansion. These policies relate to a range of topics, including access to state-owned right of way, regulation of pole attachments, and the siting of wireless or small wireless facilities on state-owned land. States have also adopted policies that address access to locally owned infrastructure and assets to facilitate broadband expansion.

**Right of way [Dig once, railroad, ROW—other]** : Policies address access to roads, railroads, tribal lands, and other public rights of way. “Dig once” statutes, which coordinate conduit installation with transportation projects with the goal of lowering costs for deployment and reducing construction in the right of way, fall under right of way policies.

**Pole attachments [Pole attachments]** : Requirements regarding pole attachments (used to attach cables or fiber to telephone poles), including for municipalities, cooperatives, and publicly owned utilities. State statutes may direct the public utilities commission to adopt rules for pole attachments.

**Wireless [Wireless facilities] and small cell wireless facilities [Small cell facilities]** : Policies define siting and permitting requirements for wireless and small wireless facilities to facilitate broadband connectivity.

**Other [Other infrastructure access]** : States have additional policies governing providers’ access to infrastructure, including laws focused on access to multiunit dwellings and easements across private lands.

**Permitting [Permitting]** : States have policies that address permits for broadband infrastructure, wireless facilities, or small cell facilities either by state agencies or localities.

**Open access [Open access]** : Policies that define whether internet service providers can offer connectivity via a network they do not own or operate.

**Other:** State policies that do not fit in the other categories. These policies include legislative intent **[Legislative intent]**, often a declaration of broadband’s importance to the state’s future. Other **[Other]** policies in this category address broadband-related wage requirements, advisory committee responsibilities, and agency directives, among others.
