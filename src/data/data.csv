Consequently, the installation and operation of broadband services within the easements are merely changes in the manner or degree of the granted use as appropriate to accommodate a new technology and, absent any applicable express prohibition contained in the instrument conveying or granting the easement, shall be deemed as a matter of law to be permitted use within the scope of every such easement.&para;(9) The provisions of this chapter are reasonably related to the legislative objective of facilitating access to broadband services in unserved areas throughout the State.",States the legislative intention to encourage investment in broadband infrastructure and promote installation authorization of advanced communications capabilities within existing easements and other rights of way.
