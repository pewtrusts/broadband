<div id="pct-overview" class="pct-overview"><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Pew’s state broadband policy explorer lets you learn how states are expanding access to broadband through laws and regulations. Filter laws and regulations by selecting from states, topics, and years. Topics are organized into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadband programs</li>
<li>Definitions </li>
<li>Funding and financing </li>
<li>Competition and regulation </li>
<li>Infrastructure access  </li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<p>The state broadband policy explorer includes state statutes related to broadband as of Jan. 1, 2019. Pew’s broadband research initiative reviewed state statutes, codes, executive orders, and other governing directives for ‘broadband’ and related terms (e.g., high-speed internet). This tool also includes information on state broadband programs gathered from state websites. All information was provided to states for review and verification.</p>
